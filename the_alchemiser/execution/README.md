# Execution Module

**Business Unit:** execution  
**Status:** current (under construction)

## Purpose

The execution module handles broker API integrations and order placement. This module is responsible for:

- **Brokers**: Broker API integrations (Alpaca, etc.)
- **Orders**: Order management and lifecycle
- **Strategies**: Smart execution strategies
- **Routing**: Order routing and placement

## Current Status

⚠️ **No logic here yet** - This module is part of Phase 1 scaffolding for the modular architecture migration. Business logic will be moved here in Phase 2.

## Dependencies

- ✅ Allowed: `shared/` module only
- ❌ Forbidden: `strategy/`, `portfolio/` modules

## Architecture Notes

This module handles all broker integrations and order placement, implements smart execution algorithms, and manages order lifecycle and error handling. It should be the only module that touches external trading APIs.
