"""Business Unit: execution | Status: legacy.

Backward compatibility module for the legacy execution module.

This module provides minimal implementations and imports to maintain compatibility
with existing code that imports from the_alchemiser.execution while the system
transitions to execution_v2.

DEPRECATED: Use execution_v2 module for new code.
"""

# ruff: noqa
# This module exists solely for backward compatibility
# All new code should use execution_v2
