"""Business Unit: orchestration | Status: current

Cross-module orchestration components.

This module provides orchestration logic that coordinates between business units
(strategy, portfolio, execution) without belonging to any specific one. The orchestration
layer acts as the "conductor" for complex workflows that span multiple modules.

Exports:
    - SignalOrchestrator: Signal analysis workflow orchestration
    - TradingOrchestrator: Trading execution workflow orchestration  
    - StrategyOrchestrator: Multi-strategy coordination
    - PortfolioOrchestrator: Portfolio rebalancing workflow orchestration
