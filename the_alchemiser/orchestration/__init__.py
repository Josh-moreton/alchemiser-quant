"""Business Unit: orchestration | Status: current.

Cross-module orchestration components.

This module provides orchestration logic that coordinates between business units
(strategy, portfolio, execution) without belonging to any specific one. The orchestration
layer acts as the "conductor" for complex workflows that span multiple modules.

Uses pure event-driven orchestration for modern, decoupled, and extensible architecture.
Traditional direct-call orchestrators have been removed in favor of event-driven patterns.

Also includes CLI components that orchestrate user interactions and coordinate
cross-module workflows through command-line interfaces.

Exports:
    - EventDrivenOrchestrator: Event-driven workflow orchestration
