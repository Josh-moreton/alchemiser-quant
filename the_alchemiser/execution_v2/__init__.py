"""Business Unit: execution | Status: current.

New execution module built around DTO consumption principle.

This module provides a clean, minimal execution system that:
- Consumes RebalancePlan without recalculation
- Delegates order placement to shared AlpacaManager
- Focuses solely on order execution
- Maintains clean module boundaries
- Communicates exclusively via events in the event-driven architecture

Public API (Event-Driven):
- register_execution_handlers: Event handler registration for orchestration

Legacy API (Being Phased Out):
- ExecutionManager: Direct access manager (for migration only)
- ExecutionResult: Result DTO (for migration only)
