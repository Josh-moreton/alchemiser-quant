"""Business Unit: portfolio | Status: current.

Portfolio state management and rebalancing logic.

Portfolio_v2 is a minimal, DTO-first module that:
- Consumes StrategyAllocation (from shared.schemas)
- Uses shared Alpaca capabilities for current positions/prices
- Produces clean RebalancePlan with BUY/SELL/HOLD items
- Does no order placement, execution hinting, or analytics
- Communicates exclusively via events in the event-driven architecture

This module implements the core design principle:
- Inputs: StrategyAllocation (weights and constraints) + current snapshot (positions, prices, cash)
- Output: RebalancePlan containing BUY/SELL/HOLD items and trade_amounts (Decimal)
- No side effects; no cross-module state; single pass O(n) over symbols

Public API (Event-Driven):
- register_portfolio_handlers: Event handler registration for orchestration

Legacy API (Being Phased Out):
- PortfolioServiceV2: Direct access service (for migration only)
- RebalancePlanCalculator: Internal calculator (for migration only)
