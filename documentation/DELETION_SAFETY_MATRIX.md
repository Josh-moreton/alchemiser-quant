# Legacy DDD Architecture Deletion Safety Matrix

## Quick Reference Guide

This matrix provides a quick reference for the safety level of deleting each category of legacy files identified in the audit.

## Safety Categories

### ✅ **COMPLETED - Safe Deletion (51 files deleted)**

| Category | Count | Risk Level | Status | Verification |
|----------|-------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Empty `__init__.py` files | 35 | LOW | ✅ DELETED | Lint check passed |
| Orphaned config utilities | 11 | LOW | ✅ DELETED | Import test passed |
| Unused validation helpers | 5 | LOW | ✅ DELETED | Smoke test passed |

**Completion Summary:**
- [x] 51 files successfully deleted (Dec 2024)
- [x] System health verified after each batch
- [x] Zero lint error increase
- [x] Python import functionality maintained
- [x] All verification checks passed

**Tools Used:**
- `scripts/delete_legacy_safe.py` - Executed with --batch-size 20 --verify
- System health monitoring - Continuous verification during deletion

### ✅ **COMPLETED - Import Migration (2 core files migrated)**

| Category | Count | Risk Level | Status | Verification |
|----------|-------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Core execution components | 2 | HIGH | ✅ MIGRATED | Files moved to execution module |
| Import updates | 6 | MEDIUM | ✅ COMPLETED | All imports updated |

**Completion Summary:**
- [x] `engine_service.py` moved to `execution/core/trading_engine.py`
- [x] `smart_execution.py` moved to `execution/strategies/smart_execution.py` 
- [x] 6 files updated with new import paths
- [x] All syntax checks passed
- [x] Module __init__.py files updated to expose moved classes

**Migration Details:**
- Preserved exact functionality while organizing into proper modules
- Conservative approach: moved files rather than replacing classes
- All imports updated: CLI, trading_executor, execution adapters, portfolio services
- Verification confirmed no broken imports or syntax errors

### 🟡 **CAUTION - Migration Required (66 files remaining)**

| Category | Count | Risk Level | Action | Timeline |
|----------|-------|------------|--------|----------|
| Policy implementations | 20 | MEDIUM | 🔄 Update references | 1-2 weeks |
| Strategy adapters | 18 | MEDIUM | 🔄 Verify equivalents | 1-2 weeks |
| Configuration files | 15 | MEDIUM | 🔄 Check dependencies | 1 week |
| Remaining execution components | 13 | MEDIUM | 🔄 Migrate imports | 1-2 weeks |

**Critical Path Files (Block deletion until migrated):**
1. ~~`application/trading/engine_service.py`~~ - ✅ **MIGRATED** to `execution/core/trading_engine.py`
2. ~~`application/execution/smart_execution.py`~~ - ✅ **MIGRATED** to `execution/strategies/smart_execution.py`
3. `application/tracking/strategy_order_tracker.py` - Order tracking (6 imports)

**Migration Process:**
1. Map all importers of legacy file
2. Update imports to new modular equivalents
3. Test functionality with new imports
4. Delete legacy file after verification

### 🔴 **HIGH RISK - Manual Investigation (177 files)**

| Category | Count | Risk Level | Action | Timeline |
|----------|-------|------------|--------|----------|
| Business logic w/o equivalents | 45 | HIGH | 🔍 Manual review | 4-6 weeks |
| Complex DDD infrastructure | 80 | HIGH | 🔍 Architecture review | 4-6 weeks |
| Unknown/unclear files | 52 | HIGH | 🔍 Code analysis | 2-4 weeks |

**Investigation Required:**
- Manual code review for business value
- Determine if logic exists in new modules  
- Extract any missing business logic
- Update architecture documentation
