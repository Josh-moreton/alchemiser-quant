# Migration Archive

This directory contains temporary documentation files created during the Alpaca API consolidation project.

## Project Summary

**Alpaca API Consolidation (2024) - COMPLETED âœ…**
- **Goal**: Consolidate scattered direct Alpaca imports into shared broker abstractions
- **Result**: 77% reduction in direct Alpaca imports (from 22 files down to 5 files)
- **Impact**: Improved maintainability, testability, and broker-agnostic architecture

## Archive Contents

This archive contains:
- **Migration reports**: Step-by-step documentation of each consolidation batch
- **Analysis documents**: Duplicate analysis, dependency audits, and safety matrices  
- **Planning documents**: Migration strategies and phase planning
- **Progress tracking**: Consolidation progress and completion summaries

## Files Archived

The following types of files have been archived:
- `BATCH_*_MIGRATION_*.md` - Individual migration batch reports and plans
- `*_ANALYSIS.md` - Code analysis and duplicate detection reports
- `*_AUDIT_*.md` - Legacy code audits and compatibility checks
- `ALPACA_CONSOLIDATION_*.md` - Overall consolidation progress tracking
- `*_MIGRATION_*.md` - Various migration-specific documentation

## Final State

All consolidation work is complete. The remaining 5 files with direct Alpaca imports are architecturally appropriate:

1. `shared/brokers/alpaca_utils.py` - Centralized Alpaca utility layer
2. `shared/types/broker_enums.py` - Broker-agnostic abstractions with Alpaca converters
3. `shared/types/broker_requests.py` - Broker-agnostic request abstractions  
4. `execution/brokers/alpaca/adapter.py` - Direct broker adapter (integration boundary)
5. `shared/utils/order_completion_utils.py` - Type annotations only

## Notes

These files served their purpose during the migration process but are no longer needed for day-to-day development. They have been archived here for historical reference and to keep the root directory clean.
