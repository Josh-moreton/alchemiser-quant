## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None identified. File is simple, well-scoped, and does not handle critical operations.

### High
**RESOLVED**: Missing comprehensive test coverage
- **Issue**: No tests existed for this file prior to audit
- **Impact**: Untested public API poses regression risk during migration
- **Resolution**: Created comprehensive test suite with 25 tests including property-based tests

### Medium
**RESOLVED**: Missing comprehensive docstrings
- **Issue**: Original docstrings lacked Args/Returns/Raises/Example sections
- **Impact**: Reduced maintainability and developer experience
- **Resolution**: Enhanced all docstrings with complete sections, examples, and migration context

**ACCEPTED AS DESIGNED**: Hardcoded return values
- **Issue**: `1.0` allocation and `True` return are magic values
- **Impact**: Minimal - this is intentional for DSL-only phase
- **Status**: Accepted - values are clearly documented as phase-specific

### Low
**RESOLVED**: Parameter naming clarity
- **Issue**: `_strategy_type` parameter uses underscore prefix in original
- **Impact**: Underscore prefix convention typically indicates private/unused
- **Resolution**: Renamed to `strategy_type` with clear documentation about parameter being unused

### Info/Nits
- ✅ File is 67 lines (well under 500 line soft limit)
- ✅ Module header correctly identifies business unit and status
- ✅ No security concerns (no secrets, no I/O, no eval/exec)
- ✅ Type annotations are complete and correct
- ✅ No dead code identified
- ✅ Cyclomatic complexity = 1 per method (well under limit of 10)

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Single responsibility: Provides strategy allocation defaults during migration
  - ✅ No mixing of concerns: Pure utility class, no I/O, no business logic
  
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ✅ Class docstring enhanced with example usage
  - ✅ Both methods have complete docstrings with Args/Returns/Examples
  - ✅ Note sections explain API compatibility decisions
  
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ Return types specified: `dict[StrategyType, float]` and `bool`
  - ✅ Parameter types specified: `StrategyType`
  - ✅ No `Any` types used
  - ✅ Type checking passes with strict mypy config
  
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - N/A - No DTOs in this file (uses enum types)
  
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ✅ Float value `1.0` is acceptable here (allocation weight, not currency)
  - ✅ Tests verify sum of allocations using tolerance (`abs(total - 1.0) < 1e-10`)
  - ✅ No float comparison operators in implementation
  
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ✅ No error handling needed - methods cannot fail
  - ✅ Type system enforces valid inputs (StrategyType enum)
  - ✅ No exceptions raised or caught
  
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✅ Methods are pure functions with no side effects
  - ✅ Tests verify deterministic behavior across multiple calls
  - ✅ Returns same result for same input (idempotent)
  
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ Implementation is deterministic (no time, no random)
  - ✅ Property-based tests verify consistency across multiple invocations
  
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No secrets or sensitive data
  - ✅ No user input validation needed (type-safe enum parameter)
  - ✅ No eval, exec, or dynamic imports
  - ✅ Static methods only, no mutable state
  
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - N/A - No logging needed in pure utility functions
  - ✅ No state changes to log
  
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ✅ 25 comprehensive tests created (previously 0)
  - ✅ All public methods tested
  - ✅ Property-based tests for determinism and type safety
  - ✅ 100% code coverage for this file
  
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ No I/O operations
  - ✅ O(1) complexity for both methods
  - ✅ No allocations in hot paths (returns constant dict)
  
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ Cyclomatic complexity: 1 per method (no branches)
  - ✅ Cognitive complexity: 1 per method (trivial)
  - ✅ Method lengths: 13 and 20 lines (well under 50)
  - ✅ Parameters: 0 and 1 (well under 5)
  
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ File is 67 lines (far below limits)
  
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ Single import: `from the_alchemiser.shared.types.strategy_types import StrategyType`
  - ✅ Absolute import, no relative imports
  - ✅ No wildcard imports

## 5) Additional Notes

### Design Rationale

This file serves as a **compatibility bridge** during the migration to strategy_v2 architecture. Key design decisions:

1. **DSL-only allocation**: The hardcoded `1.0` allocation to DSL strategy is intentional for the current migration phase. This allows integration testing without complex multi-strategy coordination.

2. **Always-enabled pattern**: The `is_strategy_enabled` method always returns `True` to maintain API compatibility with code expecting this method, while actual strategy selection is controlled through allocation weights.

3. **Static methods**: Both methods are static as they don't require instance state. This is appropriate for compatibility/bridge code.

### Migration Path

This file will likely be:
- **Phase 1 (Current)**: DSL-only operation, hardcoded values
- **Phase 2**: Multiple strategies with configurable allocations
- **Phase 3**: Eventually deprecated once migration to strategy_v2 is complete

### Alignment with Architecture

- ✅ Follows module boundary rules (shared → types)
- ✅ No cross-module dependencies beyond enum types
- ✅ No business logic (pure configuration/compatibility layer)
- ✅ Aligns with event-driven architecture (provides data for event payloads)

### Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Return type validation (dict structure, key/value types)
- Value constraints (non-negative, sum to 1.0, within range)
- Determinism (multiple calls return same result)
- API compatibility (both methods accessible, correct signatures)
- Property-based tests (Hypothesis) for all StrategyType enum values
- Edge cases (dict independence, parameter handling)

**Test Statistics:**
- Total tests: 25
- Test classes: 4
- Property-based tests: 2
- Line coverage: 100%
- Branch coverage: 100%

### Comparison with Similar Files

Compared to other value objects in `shared/types/`:
- **Money.py**: More complex (arithmetic, validation, currency handling)
- **Percentage.py**: Similar simplicity but with validation logic
- **strategy_registry.py**: Simpler (static data only), appropriate for bridge code

### Performance Characteristics

- **Time complexity**: O(1) for both methods
- **Space complexity**: O(1) - returns single-element dict
- **Memory allocation**: Minimal (small dict with enum keys)
- **Thread safety**: Yes (no mutable state)

### Future Enhancements

Recommended for future phases:
1. Load allocations from configuration file (already exists in `config/strategy_profiles.py`)
2. Add validation to ensure allocations sum to 1.0
3. Implement actual enablement logic when needed
4. Consider using constants for magic values if they persist
