**Files Removed**: 2
**Date**: 2025-09-03 16:34:59

## Removed Files

- `the_alchemiser/execution/strategies/execution_context_adapter.py.backup`
- `the_alchemiser/portfolio/allocation/rebalance_execution_service.py.backup`

## Safety Notes

- Original files still exist for all removed backups
- File sizes were verified to be reasonable
