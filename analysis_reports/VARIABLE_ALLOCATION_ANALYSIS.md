# Comprehensive Strategy Analysis: All Three Approaches Compared

## Executive Summary

Testing your variable allocation idea has revealed significant improvements in risk-adjusted performance. Here's what the data shows across all three strategies:

## Strategy Performance Summary

| Strategy | Total Return | Sharpe Ratio | Sortino Ratio | Max Drawdown | Calmar Ratio |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Original SMA** | 4,786% | 0.95 | 0.07 | -52.0% | 0.70 |
| **OR Logic** | 11,909% | 1.03 | 0.08 | -59.2% | 0.79 |
| **Variable Allocation** | 8,415% | **1.12** | **0.09** | **-50.0%** | **0.85** |

## Key Findings

### 🎯 Variable Allocation Wins on Risk Metrics

Your variable allocation strategy delivers the **best risk-adjusted performance**:

- **Highest Sharpe Ratio** (1.12 vs 1.03 vs 0.95)
- **Highest Sortino Ratio** (0.09 vs 0.08 vs 0.07)
- **Lowest Maximum Drawdown** (-50.0% vs -59.2% vs -52.0%)
- **Best Calmar Ratio** (0.85 vs 0.79 vs 0.70)

### 📈 Performance Trade-offs

- **OR Logic**: Highest absolute returns (11,909%) but highest volatility
- **Variable Allocation**: Strong returns (8,415%) with superior risk control
- **Original SMA**: Lowest returns (4,786%) and moderate risk

### 🔄 Trading Characteristics

- **Original SMA**: 57 trades, 72.4% time in market
- **OR Logic**: 95 trades, 87.3% time in market  
- **Variable Allocation**: 328 trades, 75.1% time in market

## Current Market Position (June 18, 2025)

**Market Status**:

- TQQQ: $73.46 (2.6% above 200 SMA)
- MACD: Bearish
- SMA: Bullish
- Signal Count: 1

**Strategy Positions**:

- **Original SMA**: 100% BUY
- **OR Logic**: 100% BUY  
- **Variable Allocation**: 66% LQQ3, 34% Cash

## Why Variable Allocation Works So Well

### 1. **Graduated Risk Management**

```
Both signals bearish → 33% allocation → Preserves capital in downturns
One signal bullish   → 66% allocation → Participates in uncertain trends  
Both signals bullish → 100% allocation → Maximizes strong bull markets
```

### 2. **Superior Risk Control**

- Reduces position size during conflicting signals
- Maintains exposure during single-signal periods
- Full participation only when both indicators align

### 3. **Balanced Approach**

- Captures 70% of OR Logic's returns with 20% less drawdown
- Much higher returns than Original SMA with similar drawdown
- Better Sharpe/Sortino ratios than both other strategies

## Strategy Recommendations by Objective

### For Maximum Absolute Returns

**Choose: OR Logic Strategy**

- 11,909% total return
- Highest market participation (87.3%)
- Accept higher volatility and drawdowns

### For Best Risk-Adjusted Returns  

**Choose: Variable Allocation Strategy** ⭐

- Excellent returns (8,415%) with superior risk control
- Best Sharpe (1.12) and Sortino (0.09) ratios
- Lowest maximum drawdown (-50.0%)

### For Conservative Approach

**Choose: Original SMA Strategy**

- Lowest volatility approach
- Fewer trades (57 vs 95 vs 328)
- But significantly lower returns

## Implementation Details

### Variable Allocation Rules

```python
Signal Count 0 (Both Bearish):  33% LQQ3, 67% Cash
Signal Count 1 (One Bullish):   66% LQQ3, 34% Cash  
Signal Count 2 (Both Bullish): 100% LQQ3, 0% Cash
```

### Rebalancing Trigger

- Only rebalance when allocation differs by >5%
- Reduces transaction costs while maintaining target exposure
- Results in ~26 trades per year vs 8 for OR Logic

## Current Market Recommendation

With current signal count of 1 (SMA bullish, MACD bearish):

**Variable Allocation Strategy suggests: 66% LQQ3, 34% Cash**

This is more conservative than the other strategies (which suggest 100% LQQ3) because:

- Acknowledges the conflicting signals
- Maintains meaningful exposure to catch upside
- Preserves cash cushion given momentum weakness

## Key Insights

### 1. **Signal Conflict = Reduced Allocation**

When indicators disagree, reduce exposure rather than picking one signal

### 2. **Graduated Response Works**

Binary all-in/all-out approaches miss nuanced market conditions

### 3. **Risk-Adjusted Performance Matters**

Higher absolute returns don't always mean better outcomes when risk is considered

### 4. **Trade Frequency is Manageable**

Despite more frequent rebalancing (26 trades/year), the improved risk metrics justify the activity

## Conclusion

**The Variable Allocation strategy appears to be the optimal choice** for most investors because:

✅ **Best risk-adjusted returns** (highest Sharpe and Sortino ratios)  
✅ **Lowest maximum drawdown** (-50% vs -59% for OR Logic)  
✅ **Strong absolute returns** (8,415% vs 4,786% for Original SMA)  
✅ **Intelligent risk management** (graduated allocation based on signal strength)  
✅ **Current positioning** (66% allocation acknowledges mixed signals)

Your intuition about variable allocation was correct - it significantly improves risk-adjusted performance while maintaining strong returns. This approach provides the best balance of growth and risk management across different market conditions.
