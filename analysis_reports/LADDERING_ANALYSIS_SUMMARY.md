# Laddering Strategy Analysis: Complete Results & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

After extensive testing of various laddering and allocation strategies, the analysis reveals that **asymmetric position sizing significantly improves risk-adjusted returns** compared to simple binary allocation. The optimal approach uses graduated entry but more conservative exit strategies.

## Strategy Performance Comparison

| Strategy | Total Return | Sharpe Ratio | Sortino Ratio | Max Drawdown | Avg Allocation | Trades/Year |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Binary Exit (Recommended)** | 6,187% | **1.15** | **1.46** | **-44.0%** | 63.6% | 22.1 |
| Pure Binary (OR Logic) | 12,383% | 1.04 | 1.34 | -59.7% | 91.4% | 8.6 |
| Symmetric Laddering | 6,829% | 1.08 | 1.42 | -48.2% | 74.8% | 23.8 |
| Asymmetric Laddering | 5,992% | 1.14 | 1.45 | -44.0% | 63.7% | 22.1 |
| Buy-Only Laddering | 6,123% | 1.14 | 1.46 | -44.0% | 63.6% | 22.3 |

## Key Findings

### 1. Laddering Improves Risk-Adjusted Returns

- **15% better Sharpe ratio** compared to pure binary allocation (1.15 vs 1.04)
- **25% lower maximum drawdown** (-44.0% vs -59.7%)
- **More consistent performance** with better downside protection

### 2. Exit Strategy Matters More Than Entry

The analysis shows that **how you exit positions is more critical than how you enter**:

- **Graduated entries** (33% → 66% → 100%) work well for building positions
- **Conservative exits** (any signal deterioration → reduce to 33%) provide better risk management
- **Asymmetric approaches** (gradual in, faster out) optimize the risk/reward trade-off

### 3. Signal Strength-Based Allocation Works

Variable allocation based on signal count (0/1/2 bullish signals) provides:

- **Better drawdown control** than binary allocation
- **Higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios**
- **More rational position sizing** aligned with conviction level

## Recommended Strategy: "Binary Exit with Laddered Entry"

### Allocation Rules

```
Signal State → Allocation
0 bullish signals → 33% LQQ3, 67% cash
1 bullish signal  → 66% LQQ3, 34% cash  
2 bullish signals → 100% LQQ3, 0% cash
```

### Trading Rules

**Entry (Gradual Laddering)**:

- 0→1 signal: Increase allocation from 33% to 66%
- 1→2 signals: Increase allocation from 66% to 100%

**Exit (Conservative Binary)**:

- ANY signal deterioration from high allocation (≥66%): Reduce to 33%
- Protects against whipsaws and preserves capital during uncertainty

### Why This Works Best

1. **Gradual entry** allows building positions as conviction increases
2. **Quick exit** preserves capital when any doubt emerges
3. **Always maintains minimum position** (33%) to avoid missing rebounds
4. **Balances participation with protection**

## Current Market Application (June 2025)

**Current Status**:

- MACD: Bearish (below signal line)
- SMA: Bullish (price above 200-day SMA)
- Signal Count: 1 bullish signal
- **Recommended Allocation: 66% LQQ3, 34% cash**

**Next Actions**:

- If MACD turns bullish → Increase to 100% LQQ3
- If SMA turns bearish → Reduce to 33% LQQ3
- Monitor daily for signal changes

## Performance vs Original Strategies

| Strategy | Total Return | Excess Return | Max Drawdown | Sharpe |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| **Binary Exit (New)** | 6,187% | 782% | -44.0% | **1.15** |
| Original OR Logic | 10,189% | 4,784% | -59.2% | 1.00 |
| Original 200-day SMA | ~2,000% | -3,400% | -52% | ~0.60 |

### Trade-offs Analysis

- **Lower total returns** than pure OR logic (-4,000% less)
- **Significantly better risk metrics** (15% better Sharpe, 25% lower drawdown)
- **More stable performance** with less volatility
- **Better suited for investors prioritizing risk management**

## Implementation Guidelines

### Daily Monitoring

1. Check TQQQ price vs 200-day SMA (currently $73.46 vs $71.59)
2. Check MACD vs signal line (currently bearish)
3. Count bullish signals (currently 1)
4. Verify current allocation matches target (should be 66%)

### Rebalancing Triggers

- **Only rebalance when signal count changes**
- **Use end-of-day prices** to avoid intraday noise
- **Account for transaction costs** in rebalancing decisions

### Risk Management

- **Maximum allocation**: 100% during strongest signals
- **Minimum allocation**: 33% to avoid missing recoveries  
- **Stop-loss**: None needed (signal-based exits provide protection)
- **Position sizing**: Based purely on signal strength

## Conclusion

The **Binary Exit with Laddered Entry** strategy represents the optimal balance between:

- **Growth potential** (still delivers 6,187% returns)
- **Risk management** (44% lower drawdown than pure binary)
- **Practical implementation** (clear, rules-based approach)

This approach acknowledges that **uncertainty deserves reduced position sizes** while maintaining enough exposure to benefit from bull markets. The asymmetric design (gradual in, quick out) aligns with behavioral finance principles and market realities.

**Bottom Line**: If you prioritize risk-adjusted returns over maximum returns, the Binary Exit strategy with laddered entry provides the best Sharpe ratio (1.15) and drawdown protection (-44%) while still delivering substantial outperformance vs buy-and-hold.
