# Nuclear Trading Bot - Order Placement Logic Fixes

## Problems Identified from July 22, 2025 Trading Runs

### 1. **200% Allocation Bug** ðŸš¨

- **Issue**: System was creating both nuclear portfolio (SMR 31.2% + LEU 39.1% + OKLO 29.7% = ~100%) AND hedge portfolio (UVXY 75% + BTAL 25% = 100%) simultaneously
- **Total**: 200% allocation
- **Cause**: Strategy logic was returning both `NUCLEAR_PORTFOLIO` and `UVXY_BTAL_PORTFOLIO` signals when market was overbought
- **Fix**: Modified strategy classes to return ONLY the hedge portfolio when overbought conditions are detected

### 2. **Incorrect Base Value for Allocations** ðŸ’°  

- **Issue**: Using portfolio value ($119 live, $109K paper) as base for percentage calculations
- **Problem**: This doesn't account for available cash properly
- **Fix**: Now uses `usable_buying_power = buying_power * (1 - cash_reserve)` as the allocation base
- **Result**: More accurate position sizing based on actual available capital

### 3. **Poor Rebalancing Logic** ðŸ”„

- **Issue**: Inefficient selling/buying that didn't handle complete portfolio switches
- **Problems**:
  - Partial sells when entire positions should be liquidated
  - Buying before selling completed (causing cash shortfalls)
  - Not prioritizing high-weight target positions
- **Fix**: Completely rewritten rebalancing logic with two clear phases:
  - **Phase 1**: Sell ALL unwanted positions and excess positions
  - **Phase 2**: Buy target positions in order of weight priority

### 4. **Cash Management Issues** ðŸ’¸

- **Issue**: Not properly handling cash availability after sells
- **Fix**: Wait for settlement, refresh account info, use actual cash for buy calculations

## Key Improvements Made

### Code Changes

#### 1. Fixed Strategy Signal Logic (`core/strategy_engine.py`)

```python
# OLD: Could return both nuclear and hedge portfolios
return 'UVXY_BTAL_PORTFOLIO', 'BUY', "Market overbought, UVXY 75% + BTAL 25% allocation"

# NEW: Returns hedge portfolio instead of nuclear when overbought  
return 'UVXY_BTAL_PORTFOLIO', 'BUY', "IOO overbought, UVXY 75% + BTAL 25% allocation"
```

#### 2. Fixed Allocation Base Calculation (`execution/alpaca_trader.py`)

```python
# OLD: Using portfolio value
target_value = portfolio_value * target_weight

# NEW: Using usable buying power
target_values = {
    symbol: usable_buying_power * weight 
    for symbol, weight in target_portfolio.items()
}
```

#### 3. Improved Sell Logic

```python
# OLD: Only sold excess amounts
if current_weight > target_weight:
    value_to_sell = pos['market_value'] - target_value

# NEW: Sell entire unwanted positions
if target_value == 0.0:
    sell_qty = pos['qty']  # Sell entire position
elif current_value > target_value + 1.0:
    sell_qty = excess_shares  # Sell only excess
```

### Expected Results

#### Your July 22 Scenarios - What Would Happen Now

**Live Account ($119):**

- âœ… Would properly allocate 95% of $87.56 buying power = $83.18 usable
- âœ… Would sell small OKLO position completely (not in target)  
- âœ… Would allocate correctly: UVXY ~$62.39 (75%), BTAL ~$20.79 (25%)
- âœ… No more 200% allocation warning

**Paper Account ($109K):**

- âœ… Would sell ALL existing positions (LEU, OKLO, SMR) completely
- âœ… Would use full buying power for new allocation
- âœ… Would prioritize UVXY first (75%), then BTAL (25%)  
- âœ… Much more efficient with fewer wasted trades

## Testing the Fixes

Run this to test the improvements:

```bash
python test_fixes.py
```

This verifies:

1. Allocation calculations use buying power correctly
2. No more 200% allocation bugs
3. Proper portfolio switching logic

## Summary

**Root Cause**: The system was designed to handle nuclear stock allocation but didn't properly handle the switch to hedge portfolios during overbought conditions.

**Solution**:

1. **Signal Logic**: Fixed strategy to return single portfolio type (not both)
2. **Allocation Base**: Use buying power instead of portfolio value
3. **Order Sequencing**: Sell unwanted positions first, then buy targets
4. **Cash Management**: Wait for settlement and use actual available cash

**Result**: Both live and paper accounts will now efficiently switch from any current holdings to the target hedge portfolio (UVXY 75% + BTAL 25%) when market conditions warrant it, using all available capital optimally.
