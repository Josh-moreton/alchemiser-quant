# Shims & Compatibility Layers Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report identifies **4 confirmed shims and compatibility layers** in the codebase that require attention. This focused audit only includes files that are definitively shims, import redirections, or legacy compatibility code.

**Risk Distribution:**
- ðŸ”´ **High Risk**: 2 items (mixed files with deprecated methods)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk**: 2 items (import redirections)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk**: 0 items (backup files)

**Active Usage**: 1 shims are actively imported by other files

## Detailed Findings

### ðŸ”´ HIGH RISK (2 items)

**1. position_manager.py** **[1 imports]**
- **File**: `the_alchemiser/portfolio/holdings/position_manager.py`
- **Description**: Contains actual deprecation warnings but also operational methods
- **Purpose**: Mixed file with deprecated methods and active operational code
- **Suggested Action**: Keep operational methods, coordinate removal of deprecated methods
- **Evidence**: Warning: PositionManager.validate_sell_position is deprecated. ...; Warning: PositionManager.validate_buying_power is deprecated. ...; Actively imported by 1 files for operational use

**2. asset_order_handler.py**
- **File**: `the_alchemiser/execution/orders/asset_order_handler.py`
- **Description**: Contains actual deprecation warnings but also operational methods
- **Purpose**: Mixed file with deprecated methods and active operational code
- **Suggested Action**: Keep operational methods, coordinate removal of deprecated methods
- **Evidence**: Warning: AssetOrderHandler.handle_fractionability_error is deprecated. ...; Warning: AssetOrderHandler.handle_limit_order_fractionability_error is deprecated. ...

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK (2 items)
**1. __init__.py**
- **File**: `the_alchemiser/shared/utils/__init__.py`
- **Description**: Import redirection shim
- **Purpose**: Redirects imports to new location
- **Suggested Action**: migrate_imports
- **Evidence**: Star imports: 3; Redirection language found; Short file: 18 lines

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Review 2 high-risk mixed files** - These contain deprecated methods but also operational code
2. **Handle 1 actively imported files** - Ensure operational methods remain available
3. **Document deprecated method alternatives** - Provide clear migration paths

### Suggested Action Priority

1. **Pure Import Redirections** â†’ Update import statements, then remove shim (COMPLETED Phase 4a-4b)
2. **Mixed Files with Deprecated Methods** â†’ Coordinate removal of deprecated methods only
3. **Legacy Code** â†’ Review, migrate functionality, then remove (COMPLETED Phase 3)
4. **Deprecated Modules** â†’ Already removed in Phase 4b (COMPLETED)

### Risk Mitigation

- **Test after each shim removal** to ensure no functionality is broken
- **Update import statements before removing shims**
- **Coordinate with team** for files with many active imports
- **Document replacement paths** for future reference

## Cross-Reference with Existing Work

This audit complements existing migration reports:
- `LEGACY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Broader legacy DDD architecture cleanup
- `STRATEGY_LEGACY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Strategy module specific cleanup
- `DELETION_SAFETY_MATRIX.md` - Safe deletion guidelines

The shims identified here are in addition to the legacy architecture cleanup already in progress.
