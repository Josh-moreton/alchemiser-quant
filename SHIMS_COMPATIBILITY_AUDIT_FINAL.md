# Shims & Compatibility Layers Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report identifies the **final 2 confirmed shims and compatibility layers** remaining in the codebase after comprehensive Phase 5 cleanup. This focused audit only includes files that are definitively shims, import redirections, or legacy compatibility code.

**Risk Distribution:**
- ðŸ”´ **High Risk**: 0 items (all deprecated methods removed)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk**: 2 items (import redirections)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk**: 0 items (backup files)

**Active Usage**: 1 file actively imported by other files (for operational methods)

## Detailed Findings

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK (2 items)

**1. position_manager.py** **[1 imports]**
- **File**: `the_alchemiser/portfolio/holdings/position_manager.py`
- **Description**: Operational file with all deprecated methods removed
- **Purpose**: Mixed file with only operational methods remaining (Phase 5 cleanup completed)
- **Suggested Action**: **COMPLETE** - All deprecated methods removed, only operational code remains
- **Evidence**: All deprecated methods successfully removed; Only operational methods used by AlpacaClient remain

**2. asset_order_handler.py**
- **File**: `the_alchemiser/execution/orders/asset_order_handler.py`
- **Description**: Operational file with all deprecated methods removed
- **Purpose**: Mixed file with only operational methods remaining (Phase 5 cleanup completed)
- **Suggested Action**: **COMPLETE** - All deprecated methods removed, only operational code remains
- **Evidence**: All deprecated methods successfully removed; Only operational methods remain

**3. __init__.py**
- **File**: `the_alchemiser/shared/utils/__init__.py`
- **Description**: Import redirection shim
- **Purpose**: Redirects imports to new location
- **Suggested Action**: migrate_imports
- **Evidence**: Star imports: 3; Redirection language found; Short file: 18 lines

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Review 1 medium-risk import redirection** - Shared utils import compatibility layer
2. **Document migration paths** - Clear guidance for remaining import redirections

### Suggested Action Priority

1. **Pure Import Redirections** â†’ Update import statements, then remove shim (COMPLETED Phase 4a-4b)
2. **Mixed Files with Deprecated Methods** â†’ **COMPLETED in Phase 5** - Deprecated methods removed from both files
3. **Legacy Code** â†’ Review, migrate functionality, then remove (COMPLETED Phase 3)
4. **Deprecated Modules** â†’ Already removed in Phase 4b (COMPLETED)

### Risk Mitigation

- **Test after each shim removal** to ensure no functionality is broken
- **Update import statements before removing shims**
- **Coordinate with team** for files with many active imports
- **Document replacement paths** for future reference

## Cross-Reference with Existing Work

This audit complements existing migration reports:
- `LEGACY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Broader legacy DDD architecture cleanup
- `STRATEGY_LEGACY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Strategy module specific cleanup
- `DELETION_SAFETY_MATRIX.md` - Safe deletion guidelines

The shims identified here are in addition to the legacy architecture cleanup already in progress.
