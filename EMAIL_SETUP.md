# Email Notification Setup Guide

## Overview

The Alchemiser now uses beautiful HTML email notifications instead of Telegram. These emails are built with Maizzle-inspired responsive design and provide comprehensive trading reports.

## Email Configuration Options

### Option 1: Config.yaml + AWS Secrets (Recommended)

1. **Update config.yaml** with your email settings:

```yaml
# Email notification configuration
email:
  smtp_server: "smtp.mail.me.com"
  smtp_port: 587
  from_email: "your-email@icloud.com"    # Your iCloud email
  to_email: "your-email@icloud.com"      # Where to send notifications
  # smtp_password is stored separately in AWS Secrets Manager
```

2. **Store password in AWS Secrets Manager** under your existing `nuclear-secrets`:

```json
{
  "email_password": "your-app-specific-password",
  // ... your other secrets like ALPACA_KEY, etc.
}
```

### Option 2: Environment Variables (Local Development)

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SMTP_SERVER="smtp.mail.me.com"
export SMTP_PORT="587"
export EMAIL_ADDRESS="your-email@icloud.com"
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-specific-password"
export RECIPIENT_EMAIL="your-email@icloud.com"
```

## iCloud Mail Setup (Recommended)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Apple ID account
2. **Generate an App-Specific Password**:
   - Go to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) and sign in
   - In the Security section, under "App-Specific Passwords", click "Generate Password"
   - Enter a label like "Alchemiser Trading Bot"
   - Copy the generated password (format: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)
   - Use this password in your configuration (not your regular iCloud password)

3. **Configuration Values**:
   - SMTP Server: `smtp.mail.me.com`
   - SMTP Port: `587`
   - Email Address: Your iCloud email address (@icloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com)
   - Email Password: The app-specific password (16 characters with dashes)
   - Recipient Email: Where you want to receive notifications (can be same as sender)

html_content = build_error_email_html("Test Alert", "This is a test email from The Alchemiser")
success = send_email_notification(
    subject="üß™ The Alchemiser - Email Test",
    html_content=html_content,
    text_content="Test email from The Alchemiser trading bot"
)

if success:
    print("‚úÖ Email sent successfully!")

    print("‚ùå Email failed to send. Check your configuration.")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify recipient email address
   - Test with a different email provider

```

## Security Notes

- **Use app passwords** instead of account passwords
- **Store credentials securely** in AWS Secrets Manager for production
- **Limit recipient list** to authorized personnel only
- **Regular credential rotation** is recommended

The email notification system provides a more professional and feature-rich alternative to Telegram notifications, with beautiful HTML templates that make monitoring your trading bot a pleasure.
