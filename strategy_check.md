# Comparison of the Python Bot and Composer “Nuclear” Strategy

## Overview

We compare the **Nuclear Energy Trading Bot** implemented in Python (`nuclear_trading_bot.py`) against the original **Composer.Trade "Nuclear Energy with Feaver Frontrunner V5" strategy** defined in `Nuclear.clj`. The goal is to determine if the Python script faithfully reproduces the Composer strategy’s trading logic. We examine buy/sell signal conditions, technical indicators (RSI, moving averages, etc.), included assets, weighting schemes, and rebalance timing. Discrepancies in logic or implementation are highlighted, and we conclude with a verdict on whether the Python bot is a true carbon copy of the Composer strategy.

## Buy/Sell Signal Logic Equivalence

**Overbought Market Detection (SPY RSI):** Both implementations begin by checking the S\&P 500 index (SPY) 10-day RSI to gauge if the market is overbought. In the Composer strategy, if SPY’s RSI(10) is above 79, it triggers the “overbought” branch. The Python bot mirrors this: it first checks if `spy_rsi_10 > 79` to decide between overbought vs normal condition handling. Within the overbought branch, an “extreme” threshold of RSI > 81 is used. The Composer code immediately switches to a volatility hedge (UVXY) if SPY’s RSI > 81. Likewise, the Python code returns a `BUY UVXY` signal for “SPY extremely overbought (RSI > 81)” when this threshold is exceeded. This confirms that the **primary overbought signal (SPY RSI > 79/81)** is identically implemented in both versions.

**Secondary Index Overbought Signals:** If SPY is moderately overbought (RSI > 79) but not past the extreme 81 threshold, both strategies then examine other indices for overbought conditions. The Composer strategy sequentially checks global equities (IOO), tech/growth (TQQQ, a 3× Nasdaq 100 ETF), large-cap value (VTV), and financials (XLF) for RSI(10) > 81, using nested `if` logic. The Python bot does the same via a loop over `['IOO','TQQQ','VTV','XLF']`, returning a UVXY buy signal if any of these indices has RSI(10) above 81. This ensures that **any extremely overbought secondary index** triggers the same protective trade in both implementations. If none of those indices are *extremely* overbought, the Composer strategy defaults to a mixed hedge (75% UVXY and 25% BTAL). The Python code also defaults to a volatility play, simplifying it to 100% UVXY (with a comment noting the 75/25 BTAL allocation is “simplified to UVXY”). This is one minor divergence: the Python bot does not include the small BTAL allocation that the Composer strategy would hold in an overbought regime absent any RSI>81 trigger. Functionally, however, both would be **in volatility protection mode** during moderately overbought conditions – the Python bot just concentrates the position entirely in UVXY.

**Sector-Specific Overbought (VOX):** The Composer strategy contains a special case for the Communications Services sector (VOX) becoming overbought (RSI > 79). In that scenario, Composer checks if XLF (financials) is *extremely* overbought (>81); if so, it moves fully to UVXY, otherwise it uses the UVXY/BTAL protective mix. The Python bot implements the same logic in `_evaluate_vox_overbought`: if VOX is overbought, and XLF’s RSI > 81, it returns UVXY; otherwise it still returns UVXY with a protective rationale. Once again the BTAL portion is omitted in the Python version, but the **buy/sell signal (to seek volatility hedge) is identical**, including the dependency on XLF’s condition for extreme cases.

**Oversold Conditions (Buy-the-Dip Signals):** If no broad or sector overbought signals are present, both strategies move to their main trading logic. Here, they look for oversold conditions on key equity indices to trigger buy signals. The **Nasdaq 100 leveraged ETF (TQQQ)** is monitored for a sharp dip: if TQQQ’s RSI(10) falls below 30, both strategies signal a contrarian buy of TQQQ. This represents buying the tech dip after a momentum washout. Similarly, if SPY’s RSI(10) is under 30 (broad market oversold), both strategies buy UPRO (3× S\&P 500) to leverage a rebound. These oversold thresholds (RSI < 30) and the corresponding trade actions (buy TQQQ or UPRO) match exactly, ensuring the **dip-buying logic** is faithfully replicated. Notably, the Python code checks the TQQQ condition first (just as the Composer script’s structure does), so if tech is oversold it takes priority over a SPY condition – this ordering is consistent across both implementations.

**Market Regime (Bull vs Bear) Logic:** When neither overbought nor oversold signals fire, both strategies then determine the market regime by comparing SPY’s price to its 200-day moving average. If SPY’s current price is above the 200-day MA (indicating an upward/bullish trend), the Composer strategy enters its “Bull” allocation, focusing on nuclear energy stocks. The Python bot performs the same check (`if spy_price > spy_ma_200:`) and treats it as a bull market if true. Conversely, if SPY is trading below the 200-day average, the Composer strategy switches to a “Bear” portfolio, and the Python code correspondingly calls its bear-market logic function. Thus, the **regime switch criterion (SPY price vs 200MA)** is identically implemented.

* **Bull Market Portfolio Selection:** In a bull regime, the Composer strategy allocates to a basket of nuclear energy equities – specifically, it selects the top 3 nuclear-related stocks based on 90-day performance and weights them (inversely by volatility) within the portfolio. The Python bot also pivots to nuclear assets in a bull market, but instead of a multi-stock basket it simply picks the single top-performing nuclear stock. The bot computes a 90-day moving-average return (`ma_return_90`) for each nuclear stock and identifies the highest performer. It then issues a buy signal for that one “top nuclear stock”. If, for some reason, no performance data is available (e.g. market data missing), the bot defaults to `SMR` as a nuclear play. In summary, **both implementations emphasize nuclear energy exposure in bull markets**, but the **Python script simplifies the allocation to one stock** instead of a diversified trio. This could lead to slightly different trade outcomes (single-stock vs basket) even though the intent is similar. We will discuss these weighting/allocation differences in a later section.

* **Bear Market Decision Tree:** In a bear regime (SPY below 200-day MA), the strategy’s logic becomes more complex, but the Python code mirrors the Composer’s decision tree closely in terms of conditions and outcomes. Both approaches use a series of if/else checks to decide between defensive short positions and occasional contrarian longs. The **bear-market rules** can be summarised stepwise as follows (with corresponding code references):

  1. **Oversold Bear Hedge:** If the 1× short Nasdaq ETF, PSQ, has RSI(10) below 35 (i.e. even the defensive position is oversold), the strategy takes an *aggressive short* stance by buying SQQQ (3× short Nasdaq). This rule is identically present in both the Clojure and Python logic, ensuring that an oversold condition in the hedge triggers a levered short position.

  2. **Severe Tech Drawdown:** Otherwise, if the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has fallen by more than 10% in the last 60 trading days (60-day cumulative return < –10%), the strategies evaluate a **bonds-vs-shorts signal**. Both implementations check if long-term Treasury bonds (TLT) have a higher 20-day RSI than PSQ’s 20-day RSI (in other words, if bonds are relatively stronger than the inverse Nasdaq).

     * If **bonds are stronger** (TLT RSI20 > PSQ RSI20), it suggests an oversold extreme and preference for safety, so the strategy makes a contrarian buy of TQQQ (betting on a tech rebound).
     * If **bonds are not stronger** than PSQ, the strategy opts for a defensive short via PSQ itself (a 1× short position, less aggressive than SQQQ).
       The Python bot reproduces this logic exactly, including the RSI(20) comparisons between TLT and PSQ (through its helper `_bonds_stronger_than_psq`) and the threshold of –10% for QQQ’s 60-day return.

  3. **Moderate Bearish Trend:** If QQQ has *not* dropped 10% in 60 days, the strategies next look at the short-term trend of TQQQ (a proxy for risk appetite). They compare TQQQ’s price to its 20-day moving average:

     * If **TQQQ’s price is above its 20-day MA** (i.e. a short-term uptrend within a broader bear market), both implementations then again check the bond strength signal. If bonds are stronger than PSQ (TLT RSI20 > PSQ RSI20), the strategies take a bullish contrarian trade by buying TQQQ despite the bear regime. Otherwise, if bonds are weaker, they interpret the uptick in TQQQ with caution and instead short the rally by buying SQQQ. This yields either a long TQQQ or short SQQQ position. The Python code’s structure (`if tqqq_price > tqqq_ma_20: ...`) and outcomes match the Composer logic exactly, including the condition that **“TQQQ trending up, but bonds weak” leads to an SQQQ short position**.

     * If **TQQQ’s price is below its 20-day MA** (continuing to downtrend), the strategies consider two bond signals. First, they check if intermediate-term Treasuries (IEF) have RSI(10) greater than PSQ’s RSI(20). An IEF RSI(10) > PSQ RSI(20) indicates strength in medium-term bonds, which is a strong risk-off signal – in this case, both strategies go outright short by buying SQQQ. If that condition fails but long-term bonds (TLT) are still stronger than PSQ (TLT RSI20 > PSQ RSI20), it suggests some relative strength in bonds with tech weakness, so the strategies take a **“neutral” stance by buying QQQ** (unlevered long, effectively reducing short exposure). And if neither bond signal is positive (i.e. neither IEF nor TLT is outperforming the short QQQ proxy), the default action is to maintain a short position via SQQQ. This multi-layered decision is implemented equivalently in the Python code: it uses `_ief_stronger_than_psq` for the IEF vs PSQ comparison and `_bonds_stronger_than_psq` for the TLT vs PSQ comparison, returning SQQQ, QQQ, or SQQQ accordingly. The thresholds (IEF RSI window 10, TLT & PSQ RSI window 20) are consistent between the Clojure and Python versions.

  4. **Default Bear Stance:** If none of the above conditions triggers (which is unlikely, given the structure), the Composer strategy defaults to a short tech position (SQQQ) as a catch-all for bear market protection. The Python bot also has a final fallback return of SQQQ with reason “Bear market conditions, short tech”. In practice, most branches of the decision tree already end in an SQQQ recommendation if no contrarian long signals were justified, so this default simply confirms that **SQQQ is the position of last resort** in a confirmed bear regime.

In summary, the **decision tree logic in bear markets is almost identically translated** from the Composer strategy to the Python bot. All key conditions (PSQ RSI < 35, QQQ –10% in 60 days, TQQQ vs MA20, bond RSIs comparisons) use the same thresholds and lead to the same buy signals in both implementations. The ordering of checks is preserved such that more urgent signals (like the oversold hedge or big drop scenarios) take precedence, just as in the Composer code. Therefore, **all buy/sell trigger conditions and the overall decision logic tree are implemented equivalently** in the Python script, with the sole exception being how multi-asset outcomes are handled (discussed below).

## Technical Indicators and Parameters

All technical indicators in the Python bot use the same look-back windows and comparisons as the Composer strategy, ensuring a faithful replication of the strategy’s parameters:

* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The strategy predominantly uses a 10-day RSI for detecting overbought/oversold conditions, and a 20-day RSI in a few bond-related comparisons. The Composer code explicitly calls for RSI window 10 in all the overbought/oversold checks (e.g. `(rsi "SPY" {:window 10})` > 79/81, RSI 10 < 30 for TQQQ/SPY, etc.). In the Python implementation, RSI values are computed for each symbol with window lengths of 10 and 20 and stored (e.g. `indicators[symbol]['rsi_10']` and `['rsi_20']`). The code uses `rsi_10` for all the short-term thresholds (30, 79, 81) and uses `rsi_20` specifically for the TLT vs PSQ comparison and PSQ’s own overbought measure. This matches the Composer’s use of RSI(20) for TLT and PSQ in the bond strength checks and RSI(10) for IEF vs PSQ. In short, the **RSI periods (10 or 20 days) and threshold values (30, 35, 79, 81) are identical** in both versions.

* **Moving Averages:** The critical moving averages are the 200-day MA on SPY (to distinguish bull vs bear regime) and the 20-day MA on TQQQ (to judge short-term trend within a bear market). The Composer strategy uses `(moving-average-price "SPY" {:window 200})` and compares it to SPY’s current price. Likewise, the Python bot calculates `ma_200` for SPY and checks `if spy_price > spy_ma_200` to determine the regime. For TQQQ, the Composer uses a 20-day moving average price for the trend filter, and the Python code computes `ma_20` for TQQQ and compares `tqqq_price > tqqq_ma_20` in the same context. The use of the **same 200-day and 20-day moving averages** and their role in the logic is consistent across both implementations. All moving average calculations in Python are done via its `TechnicalIndicators.moving_average` function with the specified window lengths, so there is no deviation in how the averages are derived.

* **Cumulative Returns:** The Composer strategy’s bear logic examines the 60-day cumulative return of QQQ, checking if it’s below –10%. The Python bot similarly computes a 60-day cumulative return (`cum_return_60`) for QQQ and checks if it is < –10. The threshold of –10 (interpreted as –10%) is the same in both; the Python code likely expresses returns in percentage points, hence comparing to –10. This ensures the **detection of a –10% drawdown in QQQ over \~3 months** is aligned between the two implementations.

* **Current Price Checks:** In both systems, accessing the latest price is essential for comparisons (SPY vs its MA, TQQQ vs its MA). The Composer code uses `(current-price "SPY")` and `(current-price "TQQQ")` in those comparisons. The Python code obtains the latest price for each symbol as part of its data fetch and indicator calc (stored as `indicators[sym]['current_price']`), and uses those values for the same comparisons. Thus, the **use of current market price in decision-making** is equivalent.

Overall, the Python bot’s technical indicator usage (RSI periods, moving average windows, return lookback, etc.) exactly mirrors the Composer strategy’s parameters. There is **no discrepancy in indicator calculation or threshold values** between the two, meaning any given market data input should produce the same indicator readings for use in the decision logic.

## Asset Universe and Ticker Mapping

The set of assets (tickers) involved in the strategy is preserved in the Python implementation, covering all indices, ETFs, and stocks that the Composer strategy uses:

* **Market and Sector Indices:** The strategy monitors SPY (S\&P 500), IOO (global equities), TQQQ (leveraged Nasdaq 100), VTV (value stocks), XLF (financial sector), and VOX (communications sector) for overbought signals. These six tickers are explicitly listed in the Python bot’s configuration (`self.market_symbols`) and are used throughout the overbought condition checks. This matches the Composer code, which references the same tickers in its RSI conditions. There is no omission – for example, VOX is included and handled in both, despite being a less common index in strategies.

* **Volatility Hedge Assets:** UVXY (2× VIX futures ETF) and BTAL (anti-beta market-neutral fund) serve as the defensive hedge components. Both tickers appear in the Composer strategy (UVXY is directly bought, and BTAL is used in the 25% allocation of the protective group). In the Python bot, `self.volatility_symbols` includes `UVXY` and `BTAL`, and the data for BTAL is fetched along with everything else. In practice, however, the Python strategy logic **never explicitly buys or mentions BTAL** in its decisions – when a protective stance is needed, it either returns UVXY or does so with a note that BTAL was simplified out. The presence of BTAL in the symbols list indicates the author intended to mirror the asset universe, but the *trading logic* effectively ignores BTAL (more on this in the weighting section). UVXY, on the other hand, is fully utilised in both implementations for overbought market responses.

* **Leveraged & Inverse Equity Positions:** The strategy can go long or short tech via TQQQ (3× long Nasdaq) and SQQQ (3× short Nasdaq), or take a smaller short via PSQ (1× short Nasdaq). It also uses UPRO (3× long S\&P) for broad-market oversold situations. All these tickers are present in the Python bot’s `tech_symbols` list (`['QQQ', 'SQQQ', 'PSQ', 'UPRO']`) and are used in the logic exactly as in the Composer strategy. For instance, the Python returns ‘SQQQ’ for short positions and ‘PSQ’ for defensive ones where the Composer strategy lists those assets. Long bond proxies TLT (20-year Treasuries) and IEF (7–10 year Treasuries) are also included (`bond_symbols`) in Python and used for strength comparisons just as in Composer. The ticker mappings are consistent (e.g. *IEF* is correctly used for intermediate Treasuries – the Python helper `_ief_stronger_than_psq` uses IEF’s RSI10 vs PSQ, exactly reflecting the Composer condition with IEF).

* **Nuclear Stock Universe:** The core of the “Nuclear” strategy is its dynamic allocation to nuclear energy stocks during bull markets. The Composer strategy’s stock list includes **SMR, BWXT, LEU, EXC, NLR,** and **OKLO**. The Python bot defines the exact same list in `self.nuclear_symbols`. All six tickers match (Oklo Inc. is represented by `OKLO`, etc.), so the Python covers the intended universe. Moreover, the bot fetches market data for all these symbols and computes their 90-day returns (`ma_return_90`) to decide which to pick. Thus, the **asset universe is fully preserved**: for every asset the Composer strategy might trade or consider, the Python script includes and evaluates the same symbol. There are no missing tickers or mis-mapped symbols between the two implementations.

## Weighting and Allocation Differences

One area where the Python implementation diverges from the Composer strategy is in **portfolio weighting and multi-asset allocations**. Composer’s strategy can allocate across multiple assets simultaneously (with specified weights or weight rules), whereas the Python bot, in generating a single trade alert, effectively picks only one asset at a time. This leads to some differences in how certain branches are executed:

* **UVXY vs UVXY+BTAL (Protective Hedge Allocation):** In the Composer strategy, when the market is overbought (SPY RSI > 79) but no single index is extremely overbought (>81), the allocation is split between UVXY and BTAL. Specifically, the strategy defines a group “UVXY 75|25 BTAL” – 75% of capital to UVXY and 25% to BTAL. This combination provides volatility spike protection (UVXY) while BTAL offers an anti-beta hedge that can perform during market drawdowns. The Python bot acknowledges this intended mix but **does not actually implement the split**. In the `_evaluate_overbought_conditions` method, if no RSI > 81 triggers are hit, the code returns a UVXY buy signal (single asset) with the reason “Market overbought, volatility protection mode”. A comment notes that this is a simplification of the UVXY 75/BTAL 25 allocation. Consequently, the Python bot would put 100% into UVXY in that scenario, whereas the original strategy would hold a 75/25 UVXY-BTAL mix. This is a **trade-off made in the Python version** – it preserves the spirit of going defensive but omits holding BTAL. The result is a slightly more aggressive hedge (all UVXY) than the Composer strategy’s intended blend, so in this aspect the replication is not 1:1.

* **Bull Market Nuclear Portfolio – Single vs Multiple Stocks:** As noted earlier, Composer invests in a *portfolio* of nuclear stocks during bull markets. It uses a `weight-inverse-volatility 90` rule on the top 3 stocks (by 90-day moving average return). This means it will hold three stocks, weighted inversely to their volatility (over a 90-day window), which tends to allocate more to the less volatile names among the top performers. In contrast, the Python bot simplifies this to choosing the single top stock. It ranks the nuclear stocks by 90-day return (which is analogous to Composer’s `moving-average-return` metric) and then selects the highest performer. By calling `get_best_nuclear_stocks(..., top_n=1)` during bull regime evaluation, it effectively picks one ticker – whichever has the best recent performance. If at least one nuclear stock is in the data, the bot will always return a buy on *exactly one* stock (or `SMR` by default if none of the list had data). This means the **Python bot does not implement the equal or inverse-volatility weighting of multiple stocks**; it foregoes diversification in favour of a single-stock signal. In practical terms, the Python’s bull signal would match *one of* the three stocks the Composer strategy holds (specifically the top performer), but it would not mirror the simultaneous trades in the other two stocks, nor the nuanced weighting. This is a significant divergence in allocation approach – the logic to identify the best momentum within the nuclear basket is there, but the Python bot does not attempt to execute a basket trade. Users running the Python bot would only buy one stock where the Composer strategy would spread risk across three.

* **Bear Market Parallel Positions:** The Composer strategy’s “Bear” group is divided into two subgroups (“Bear 1” and “Bear 2”), each with similar logic but potentially yielding different positions, and then combines them with a 14-day inverse-volatility weighting. This complex structure means the Composer strategy could hold two positions concurrently in a bear market. For instance, “Bear 1” might signal SQQQ while “Bear 2” might signal QQQ in a certain scenario – the actual portfolio would then weight those positions according to their volatility (implicitly sizing them). The Python bot does **not** preserve this parallel weighting structure. Instead, it essentially merges the Bear1/Bear2 logic into one linear sequence of conditions (as described earlier) and returns a single final position. There is no concept of holding two opposing positions at once or splitting weight; the bot will pick either SQQQ, or QQQ, or TQQQ, etc., as the sole recommendation based on the prevailing condition. As a result, any scenario where the Composer strategy would have hedged by holding a mix of long and short (neutralising some exposure) cannot be replicated by the Python bot – the bot must choose one side. In many cases, the two Bear sub-strategies likely converge on the same asset (often SQQQ), so the outcomes align. But if they were to diverge, the Composer’s approach yields a hedged combination whereas the Python must pick one, potentially leading to different risk profiles. This is another area where the Python implementation is **structurally simpler** than the original strategy, sacrificing the multi-position allocation nuance. That said, the Python developer likely structured the code such that the same ultimate decisions are made in a mutually exclusive way, so it covers the intent of both Bear1 and Bear2 logic without needing two simultaneous trades. Still, the absence of the `weight-inverse-volatility 14` mechanism means no dynamic sizing based on volatility is done in Python – every signal is effectively an “all-in” allocation to whichever asset is chosen at that decision point.

* **Use of `weight-equal`:** The Composer strategy uses `weight-equal` in several places, sometimes to evenly split among multiple items, and sometimes simply to satisfy the syntax of grouping single assets. In the Python bot, since only one asset is ever returned at a time, the concept of `weight-equal` doesn’t directly apply. Whenever the Composer would have split equally between assets (e.g. if two assets were listed in a group with weight-equal), the Python either never enters such a state or would have to pick one of them based on prior logic. In practice, most `weight-equal` usages in the Composer code are for structuring the nested ifs and combining groups, rather than permanently holding multiple assets equally (except for the already-discussed cases of multi-stock portfolios). Therefore, we do not see any explicit equal-weight splits in the Python code, but this doesn’t cause a logical difference in signal generation – it mostly affects **portfolio composition, not the decision of which side to be on**.

In summary, **the Python bot replicates all the decision logic correctly but does not replicate the Composer strategy’s multi-asset allocation or weighting scheme**. It consistently collapses any multi-asset outcome into a single-asset choice. This means that while the **directional signals** (what to buy or sell) align with the Composer strategy’s intentions, the **position sizing and diversification aspects do not**. For an alerting bot that’s understandable – it’s giving one trade alert at a time – but it isn’t a 100% carbon copy of the portfolio one would hold if strictly following the Composer strategy in all its weightings. Users should be aware that the Python implementation is slightly more concentrated in its bets (and thus may behave a bit differently risk-wise) compared to the original diversified strategy.

## Rebalance Frequency and Execution Timing

The Composer strategy is configured to **rebalance on a daily frequency**, as indicated by `:rebalance-frequency :daily` in its definition. This means Composer evaluates the signals and potentially rotates the portfolio once per day (typically at market close or the next market open). The Python bot’s operation is not fixed to daily, but it can be run in ways that approximate a daily rebalance:

* If the bot is run in its default **“once” mode**, a user might schedule it to run daily (e.g. after market close) to mimic the Composer’s daily cycle. In that case, it would effectively generate one signal per day, similar to rebalancing daily. There is no explicit mention in the code of a daily schedule, but using it in a daily cron job would align with the strategy.

* The bot also offers a **“continuous” mode** where it will run the analysis repeatedly at a set interval (default every 15 minutes). In continuous mode, the Python script could generate intraday signals if indicator conditions flip intraday. This is a notable difference: the original strategy wouldn’t officially change positions mid-day because it’s constrained to daily rebalances, whereas the Python bot might issue a new alert during the day if, say, a rapid move caused RSI to cross a threshold. The code shows a loop sleeping for `interval_minutes * 60` seconds (15 minutes by default) before re-running the analysis. Unless the data provider is supplying live intraday price updates, these mid-day checks might be using incomplete data (e.g. partially formed daily candle). In any case, the **timing of evaluation is not locked to daily** in the Python implementation, so users could potentially trade more frequently than the Composer strategy intended.

It’s important to note that if the Python bot is fed daily price data (e.g. end-of-day data only), even running it more often won’t change the signal until a new day’s data arrives. The script’s design (fetching data for all symbols each run) will determine how often fresh values appear. The safe assumption is that the **Composer strategy’s daily rebalancing can be matched by running the Python bot once per day**, which would yield identical signals at each day’s close. However, the Python bot gives the flexibility (for better or worse) to check more frequently. This difference means that unless one constrains the bot to daily operation, it is **not strictly bound to the daily rebalance schedule** of the original strategy.

## Conclusion and Verdict

After a thorough comparison, we find that the Python `nuclear_trading_bot.py` script **faithfully reproduces the logical decision-making of the Composer “Nuclear Energy” strategy in almost every respect** – all the RSI threshold rules, moving average comparisons, and conditional branches are implemented with the same parameters and flow. For any given market condition, the Python bot’s choice of whether to buy tech, short tech, hedge with volatility, or rotate into nuclear stocks should match the Composer strategy’s choice, assuming it is run on equivalent data at the same time. In that sense, the **buy/sell signal logic is a true replica**.

However, there are a few **key differences that prevent it from being a 100% carbon copy** in terms of trade execution:

* The Python bot does not implement multi-asset allocations – it simplifies or ignores weighted combinations like the UVXY/BTAL hedge or the trio of nuclear stocks. This means its *portfolio composition* at any time is more concentrated than the Composer strategy’s portfolio would be.
* The handling of parallel “Bear 1/Bear 2” sub-strategies is linearised into one decision, which could theoretically change the risk-spreading intended by inverse-volatility weighting of two simultaneous positions.
* The rebalance frequency in practice can differ, as the Python bot can run intraday, whereas the Composer strategy is strictly daily. If the bot is run more often, it might generate signals that a daily-only strategy wouldn’t act upon until the day’s end.

These discrepancies mostly relate to *implementation details (weighting, timing)* rather than the core strategy logic. If one uses the Python bot in a daily fashion and is comfortable trading a single asset at a time, it will produce trades consistent with the Composer strategy’s directionality. But strictly speaking, because of the omissions in weighted allocations and potential timing differences, the Python script **cannot be considered a perfect one-to-one replication** of the Composer strategy’s full behaviour. It **captures the strategy’s logic and signals very well, but not the multi-asset allocation nuance**.

**Verdict:** The Python trading bot is an extremely close implementation of the Composer “Nuclear” strategy’s logic, and it would make the *same buy/sell decisions* at each decision point. Nevertheless, due to the simplifications in portfolio weighting (single-symbol outputs for what were multi-symbol groups) and differences in rebalancing execution, it is **not a literal carbon copy** of the Composer strategy in practice. Users should expect nearly identical trade signals from the bot, but acknowledge the minor deviations in how those trades are allocated.
