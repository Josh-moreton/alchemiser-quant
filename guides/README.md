# Guides Directory

This directory contains comprehensive guides for The Alchemiser quantitative trading system.

## Wiki Integration

According to the project's custom instructions, documentation should be maintained in the `alchemiser-quant.wiki` workspace. The guides in this directory are intended to be moved to the wiki repository when available.

### Current Guides

- **[Observability.md](./Observability.md)** - Comprehensive observability guide covering logging, error handling, monitoring, and debugging

### Intended Wiki Structure

When moved to the wiki, these guides should be organized as:

```
alchemiser-quant.wiki/
├── guides/
│   └── Observability.md
├── Overview.md (should link to Observability guide)
└── Development-Workflow.md (should link to Observability guide)
```

### Linking References

The Observability guide should be linked from:
- **Overview.md** - Include link in the monitoring/production section
- **Development-Workflow.md** - Include link in the debugging/troubleshooting section

### Usage

Until the wiki is available, developers can reference these guides directly from the main repository.
