## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
No critical issues found.

### High
No high severity issues found.

### Medium
1. **DslEvaluationError is not a typed exception from shared.errors** - The module defines its own exception type rather than using a centralized error hierarchy from `shared.errors` or `strategy_v2.errors`. While functional, this violates the copilot instruction to use typed errors from shared modules.

### Low
1. **Line 218-223: Helper function lacks comprehensive docstring** - The `to_decimal_if_number` helper inside `equal()` function lacks a full docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value, though it's simple enough to understand.

2. **Line 28: Magic number extracted to constant but could have better name** - `BINARY_OPERATOR_ARG_COUNT = 2` is accurate but the constant name is somewhat verbose compared to project patterns.

### Info/Nits
1. **Line 25: Module-level logger initialized but not strictly needed for pure functions** - The logger is defined at module level, which is correct, but operators could theoretically be even purer by taking logger as a context parameter.

2. **Test coverage is excellent** - 32 tests covering all operators with property-based testing included. This exceeds the ≥90% target for strategy modules.

3. **Line 69-76, 104-111, etc.: Logging is consistently implemented** - All operators include structured debug logging with correlation_id, which is excellent for observability.

4. **Decimal usage is correct throughout** - All numeric comparisons properly use Decimal type, avoiding float equality issues. This correctly follows the copilot instruction rule against using `==`/`!=` on floats.

5. **Type hints are complete and precise** - All functions have proper type hints with no `Any` types, meeting the typing requirements.

6. **Module size well within limits** - 279 lines (target ≤500, split at >800) ✅

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP) - Pure comparison operators only
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes - All 6 public functions documented
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful) - Complete type hints throughout
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types) - N/A - no DTOs defined in this module
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats - Excellent: all numeric comparisons use Decimal
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught - ⚠️ Uses local DslEvaluationError instead of shared.errors hierarchy
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks - N/A - pure functions with no side effects
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic - Tests are deterministic
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports - Validated at operator entry with _validate_binary_args
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops - Excellent structured logging with correlation_id
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio) - 32 tests including property-based tests for all operators
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits - Pure computation, no I/O
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5 - All functions A(1-5), well under limits. Functions 32-95 lines.
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800 - 279 lines, excellent
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports - Clean import structure

## 5) Additional Notes

### Strengths

1. **Excellent Decimal usage** - This module correctly implements the copilot instruction "Never use `==`/`!=` on floats" by converting all numeric values to Decimal before comparison. The `equal()` function even includes documentation explaining why Decimal equality is safe.

2. **Consistent structure** - All five comparison operators follow the same implementation pattern:
   - Validate argument count
   - Evaluate nodes via context
   - Convert to appropriate type (Decimal for >, <, >=, <=; polymorphic for =)
   - Perform comparison
   - Log result with correlation_id
   - Return bool

3. **Strong observability** - Every operator includes structured debug logging with correlation_id, making it easy to trace DSL evaluation through the system.

4. **DRY principle** - The `_validate_binary_args` helper eliminates code duplication for argument validation.

5. **Comprehensive testing** - 32 tests with both unit tests and property-based tests (using Hypothesis) provide excellent coverage and confidence in correctness.

6. **Low complexity** - Cyclomatic complexity ranges from A(1) to A(5), well below the ≤10 threshold. The equal function's A(5) rating is appropriate given its need to handle numeric, string, and mixed-type comparisons.

7. **Type safety** - Complete type hints with no `Any` types in the API surface.

8. **Documentation quality** - The `equal()` function's docstring includes a Notes section explaining the subtle correctness property of Decimal equality vs float equality, which demonstrates attention to financial computing requirements.

### Recommendations

1. **Error hierarchy alignment** (Medium Priority):
   - Consider moving `DslEvaluationError` to `strategy_v2.errors` module to align with the copilot instruction to use typed errors from `shared.errors`.
   - This would create a unified error hierarchy: `StrategyV2Error` → `DslEvaluationError`
   - Benefits: Better error categorization, consistent error handling patterns, clearer module boundaries

2. **Helper function documentation** (Low Priority):
   - Add a minimal docstring to the `to_decimal_if_number` helper in the `equal()` function
   - While the function is simple, documentation aids maintenance

3. **Constant naming** (Info/Nit):
   - Consider shortening `BINARY_OPERATOR_ARG_COUNT` to `BINARY_ARG_COUNT` for brevity

### Performance Considerations

- All operators are O(1) in time complexity (excluding nested node evaluation which is delegated to context)
- No memory allocation beyond local variables
- Logging is at debug level, so it can be disabled in production for performance if needed
- The `context.as_decimal()` conversion includes exception handling for invalid strings, which is appropriate defensive programming

### Integration Points

- Operators are registered via `register_comparison_operators()` called during DslEvaluator initialization
- Context provides node evaluation, which enables recursive DSL evaluation
- Logging uses module-level logger which respects system-wide logging configuration
- Error messages include operator symbols (">", "<", etc.) for clear diagnostics

### Test Coverage Analysis

Tests cover:
- Basic comparison cases (true/false paths)
- Equal values (edge case for >, <)
- Negative numbers
- Zero
- Decimal values
- Mixed types (for equal operator)
- Wrong argument counts
- Property-based tests for reflexivity, transitivity
- String equality (for equal operator)

### Compliance with Trading System Requirements

- ✅ No float equality operations
- ✅ Decimal used for all numeric comparisons
- ✅ Correlation IDs propagated for traceability
- ✅ Structured logging for audit trail
- ✅ No side effects (pure functions)
- ✅ Typed errors with clear messages
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Module size within limits
- ✅ Low cyclomatic complexity

This module represents a **gold standard** implementation for the trading system:

- **Correctness**: Properly implements comparison operators with correct Decimal usage
- **Observability**: Excellent structured logging with correlation tracking
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage including property-based tests
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure, good documentation, low complexity
- **Safety**: No float equality, proper error handling, input validation

**Findings Summary**:
