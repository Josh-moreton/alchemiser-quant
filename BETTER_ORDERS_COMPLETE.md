  - Slippage tolerance management

### ✅ Phase 4: Testing & Validation - COMPLETED

- ✅ **Core Functionality Tests** (`test_better_orders.py`)
- ✅ **Integration Tests** (`test_better_orders_integration.py`)
- ✅ **Demo Script** (`demo_better_orders.py`)

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Professional Execution Ladder

```python
# 5-Step Better Orders Execution:
# Step 0: Pre-market assessment (if before open)
# Step 1: Market timing strategy (9:30-9:35 logic)
# Step 2: Aggressive marketable limit (ask+1¢/bid-1¢)
# Step 3: Re-peg sequence (max 2 attempts, 2-3s timeouts)
# Step 4: Market order fallback
# Step 5: Execution reporting
```

### 2. Symbol-Specific Optimization

- **Leveraged ETFs** (TQQQ, SPXL, TECL): 20 bps tolerance, fast execution
- **High-Volume ETFs** (SPY, QQQ): 10 bps tolerance, better orders
- **Individual Stocks** (AAPL, MSFT): 15 bps tolerance, standard execution

### 3. Market Timing Intelligence

- **9:30-9:32 ET**: Wait for wide spreads (>5¢) to normalize
- **9:32-9:35 ET**: Normal execution with monitoring
- **After 9:35 ET**: Standard execution regardless of spreads

### 4. Intelligent Pricing

- **Aggressive marketable limits**: ask+1¢ for buys, bid-1¢ for sells
- **Spread-aware decisions**: tight (≤3¢) vs wide (>5¢) handling
- **Slippage protection**: configurable basis point limits

## 🔧 Configuration

### Default Settings

```python
better_orders_config = BetterOrdersConfig(
    enabled=True,
    execution_mode=ExecutionMode.AUTO,
    max_slippage_bps=20.0,
    aggressive_timeout_seconds=2.5,
    max_repegs=2,
    leveraged_etf_symbols=["TQQQ", "SQQQ", "TECL", "SPXL", ...],
    high_volume_etfs=["SPY", "QQQ", "TLT", "XLF", ...]
)
```

### Usage Examples

```python
# Direct order placement
order_id = order_manager.place_better_order(
    symbol="TQQQ",
    qty=100.0,
    side=OrderSide.BUY,
    max_slippage_bps=20.0
)

# Portfolio rebalancing (automatic)
target_portfolio = {"TQQQ": 0.6, "SPY": 0.4}
orders = trading_engine.rebalance_portfolio(target_portfolio)
```

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### 1. Execution Quality Improvements

- **Faster fills**: 2-3 second timeouts vs 10+ seconds
- **Better prices**: Aggressive marketable limits vs passive limits
- **Reduced slippage**: Optimized for fast-moving ETFs

### 2. Market Open Optimization

- **Smart timing**: Avoid poor fills during volatile opening minutes
- **Spread awareness**: Execute when conditions are favorable
- **Professional sequencing**: Mimics institutional execution

### 3. Risk Management

- **Slippage controls**: Symbol-specific tolerance limits
- **Re-peg limits**: Prevent excessive chasing
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Ensure execution certainty

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### 1. Comprehensive Fallbacks

- **Configuration disable**: Can turn off better orders entirely
- **Symbol-specific routing**: Only applies to appropriate symbols
- **Standard execution backup**: Always available if better orders fail

### 2. Conservative Defaults

- **20 bps slippage limit**: Protects against excessive costs
- **2-3 re-peg maximum**: Prevents infinite chasing
- **Market order fallback**: Ensures execution completion

### 3. Monitoring & Validation

- **Execution reporting**: Detailed console output
- **Price validation**: Slippage checks before orders
- **Symbol classification**: Automatic appropriate routing

## 🎯 Production Readiness

### ✅ Ready for Live Trading

- **Comprehensive testing**: Core functionality and integration validated
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing code unchanged
- **Configuration control**: Easy enable/disable
- **Symbol-specific**: Only affects appropriate instruments

### 🔧 Deployment Steps

1. **Enable configuration**: `update_better_orders_config(enabled=True)`
2. **Monitor execution**: Watch console output for better orders usage
3. **Validate performance**: Compare execution quality vs standard orders
4. **Gradual rollout**: Start with paper trading, expand to live
