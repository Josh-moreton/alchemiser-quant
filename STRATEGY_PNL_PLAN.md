# Per-Strategy P&L Tracking Plan

This plan outlines how to track profits and losses (P&L) for each trading strategy individually so that the metrics can be included in summary emails and performance reports.

## 1. âœ… Introduce a `StrategyOrderTracker` - COMPLETED

- âœ… Create a dedicated component responsible for recording every executed order along with the originating strategy.
- âœ… For each order, store the strategy identifier, order ID, symbol, side, quantity, price, and timestamp.
- âœ… Persist these records in a durable store (S3) so that order history survives restarts.
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive P&L calculations (realized, unrealized, total)
- âœ… Added S3 persistence with configurable paths
- âœ… Created email summary integration methods
- âœ… Full test coverage with 7 passing tests

## 2. âœ… Tag Orders With Strategy Information - COMPLETED

- âœ… When the `TradingEngine` executes a rebalance, pass the `StrategyType` to the execution layer.
- âœ… Immediately after each order fills, log it in the `StrategyOrderTracker` with its strategy tag.

### Implementation Completed

1. âœ… **Enhanced Portfolio Data Structure**: Modified `MultiStrategyManager.run_all_strategies()` to return portfolio allocation with strategy attribution
2. âœ… **Strategy-Symbol Mapping**: Created a mapping showing which strategy contributes to each symbol
3. âœ… **Order Tracking Integration**: Strategy information is passed through the execution chain to `StrategyOrderTracker.record_order()`
4. âœ… **Execution Layer Updates**: Modified `PortfolioRebalancer` to accept and forward strategy context

### Files Modified

- âœ… `strategy_manager.py`: Returns strategy attribution data in 3-tuple format
- âœ… `trading_engine.py`: Passes strategy info to rebalancer
- âœ… `portfolio_rebalancer.py`: Integrated order tracking with strategy attribution
- âœ… `backtest_engine.py`: Updated to handle new 3-tuple return signature
- âœ… `test_backtest.py`: Updated to handle new 3-tuple return signature
- âœ… `main.py`: Compatible with new return signature
- `portfolio_rebalancer.py`: Track strategy for each order
- Integration with `StrategyOrderTracker.record_order()`

## 3. âœ… Calculate P&L per Strategy - COMPLETED

- âœ… Use the stored order history to maintain positions and average cost on a per-strategy basis.
- âœ… Compute realized P&L when a position is reduced or closed and unrealized P&L from current market prices.
- âœ… The `StrategyOrderTracker` already implements comprehensive P&L calculations via `get_strategy_pnl()` and `get_all_strategy_pnl()` methods

## 4. âœ… Update the Execution Summary - COMPLETED

- âœ… Extended `_create_execution_summary` to include P&L metrics from the tracker.
- âœ… For every strategy, now reports `realized_pnl`, `unrealized_pnl`, `total_pnl`, `allocation_value`, and `positions` alongside the current allocation and trading signal.
- âœ… Added overall P&L summary with totals across all strategies
- âœ… Enhanced TradingEngine with current price fetching utilities for real-time P&L calculations

### Implementation Details

- âœ… **Enhanced Execution Summary**: Modified `TradingEngine._create_execution_summary()` to include comprehensive P&L data
- âœ… **Real-time P&L**: Added current price fetching for accurate unrealized P&L calculations
- âœ… **Strategy Attribution**: Each strategy now reports detailed P&L alongside signals and allocations
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures P&L failures don't break execution summary generation

## 5. âœ… Persist Historical Strategy P&L - COMPLETED

- âœ… At the end of each run, append the cumulative P&L for each strategy to a daily or monthly log.
- âœ… This history enables long-term performance tracking and dashboard integration.
- âœ… Automated daily P&L archiving integrated into TradingEngine execution flow
- âœ… S3-based persistence with configurable paths for historical P&L snapshots

### Implementation Details

- âœ… **Automated Archiving**: Added `_archive_daily_strategy_pnl()` method to TradingEngine
- âœ… **Integration Point**: Daily P&L archiving happens automatically after successful execution
- âœ… **Historical Storage**: Daily snapshots saved to S3 with date-based organization
- âœ… **Current Price Integration**: Real-time prices fetched for accurate historical P&L records

## 6. âœ… Enhance Email Reports - COMPLETED

- âœ… Modified `build_multi_strategy_email_html` to display per-strategy P&L in addition to allocations and signals.
- âœ… Keep the existing "Recent Closed Positions P&L" section for overall account performance.
- âœ… Added comprehensive P&L summary section with visual indicators
- âœ… Enhanced individual strategy displays with P&L metrics

### Implementation Details

- âœ… **Strategy P&L Integration**: Each strategy now displays realized, unrealized, and total P&L
- âœ… **Visual P&L Summary**: New dedicated P&L summary section with color-coded status indicators  
- âœ… **Position Value Display**: Current position values shown alongside P&L data
- âœ… **Enhanced Strategy Cards**: Individual strategy sections now include P&L metrics in headers

## 7. âœ… Testing - COMPLETED

- âœ… Added unit tests confirming that orders are logged with the correct strategy identifiers and that P&L calculations are accurate.
- âœ… Updated email-related tests to verify the new P&L table renders correctly.
- âœ… Comprehensive integration testing of the complete P&L tracking pipeline
- âœ… All 7 existing strategy order tracker tests passing

### Testing Coverage

- âœ… **Unit Tests**: 7 passing tests for StrategyOrderTracker functionality
- âœ… **P&L Calculation Tests**: Verified accurate P&L calculations with realistic scenarios
- âœ… **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of strategy attribution â†’ order tracking â†’ P&L calculation
- âœ… **Email Enhancement Tests**: Verified P&L data integration in email reports
- âœ… **Persistence Tests**: Confirmed daily P&L archiving functionality
