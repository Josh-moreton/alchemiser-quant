# The Alchemiser - .env example (minimal)
#
# Copy to .env and fill in values.
#
# Per-environment overrides:
#   .env          - Base config (loaded first, typically production keys)
#   .env.dev      - Dev/paper overrides (loaded on top for `cdk_deploy.sh dev`)
#   .env.staging  - Staging overrides (loaded on top for `cdk_deploy.sh staging`)
#   .env.prod     - Prod overrides (loaded on top for `cdk_deploy.sh prod`)
#
# The deploy script loads .env first, then .env.<environment> on top,
# so environment-specific files only need the keys that differ.
# All .env* files are gitignored.
###############################################

# Naming convention:
# - App settings use nested keys with double underscores (e.g., LOGGING__*, EMAIL__*)
# - Vendor/API credentials use single underscore (e.g., ALPACA_KEY)

# --- Required for local PAPER trading ---
# Provide your Alpaca paper credentials. Endpoint defaults to paper if omitted,
# but keeping it explicit helps clarity.
ALPACA_KEY=your_paper_api_key_here
ALPACA_SECRET=your_paper_secret_key_here
ALPACA_ENDPOINT=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2

# --- Optional: Logging ---
# Override app log level (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR). Defaults are fine.
LOGGING__LEVEL=INFO

# --- Optional: Data providers ---
# (No external data provider keys required)

# --- Required for local signal generation (make generate-signals) ---
# S3 bucket containing historical market data (Parquet files).
MARKET_DATA_BUCKET=alchemiser-dev-market-data
# AWS region used for accessing MARKET_DATA_BUCKET. The generate_daily_signals.py
# script defaults to us-east-1 if not provided; set this to the region where
# your MARKET_DATA_BUCKET actually resides.
# AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# --- Optional: Email notifications ---
# Leave blank to disable email. If providing, FROM is required; TO defaults to FROM.
# EMAIL__FROM_EMAIL=you@example.com
# EMAIL__TO_EMAIL=you@example.com
# EMAIL__PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
# EMAIL__SMTP_SERVER=smtp.mail.me.com
# EMAIL__SMTP_PORT=587

# --- Optional: Notification email recipient ---
# Set per-environment in your secret store. In prod, set to your main email.
# In dev/staging, set to a separate notifications email.
# NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=notifications@example.com

# --- Optional: Persistence/Mode hints (advanced) ---
# Not required when ALPACA_ENDPOINT contains "paper". When set to true/1/yes,
# forces paper mode for local persistence paths.
# ALPACA_PAPER_TRADING=true

# --- Live trading notes ---
# Preferred: In AWS Lambda, credentials are read from AWS Secrets Manager when
# AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME is present. Secret: "the-alchemiser-secrets" expects:
#   ALPACA_KEY, ALPACA_SECRET, ALPACA_ENDPOINT (set to live endpoint), and SMTP_PASSWORD if email is enabled.
# Region defaults to eu-west-2.
#
# Local live (advanced): set ALPACA_ENDPOINT=https://api.alpaca.markets/v2
# with live keys above. Exercise caution.

# --- Environment detection summary ---
# - Local development: reads from this .env (paper by default)
# - AWS Lambda: auto-detects and loads from Secrets Manager (live/paper via endpoint)
