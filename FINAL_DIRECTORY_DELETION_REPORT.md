# Final Legacy Directory Deletion Report

## Summary
Successfully completed the final step of EPIC #424 modular rework by deleting all remaining legacy DDD directories.

## Directories Deleted
- `the_alchemiser/application/` (4 files)
- `the_alchemiser/domain/` (6 files) 
- `the_alchemiser/interfaces/` (2 files)

Note: `the_alchemiser/infrastructure/` was already deleted in previous batches.

## Files Removed
**Total**: 12 files
- 8 backup files (*.backup) - Migration safety copies no longer needed
- 2 empty `__init__.py` files from legacy structure
- 2 `README.md` files from legacy directories

## Import Fixes Applied
Fixed 95+ broken import statements that were still referencing the deleted directories:
- `domain.*` imports → redirected to `strategy/`, `execution/`, `shared/`
- `application.*` imports → redirected to appropriate business units
- `interfaces.*` imports → redirected to `shared/schemas/`
- `infrastructure.*` imports → redirected to `shared/config/`, `shared/services/`

## Verification
✅ Basic syntax check passed
✅ Module import test successful
✅ Zero remaining broken imports (except deprecation warnings in strings)

## Result
**100% legacy DDD architecture elimination achieved!** The codebase now follows pure modular architecture with proper business unit separation:
- `strategy/` - Signal generation, indicators, ML models
- `execution/` - Broker integrations, order placement  
- `portfolio/` - Portfolio state, rebalancing, analytics
- `shared/` - Common utilities, types, cross-cutting concerns

EPIC #424 is now fully complete.
