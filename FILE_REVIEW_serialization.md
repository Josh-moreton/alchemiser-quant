## 0) Metadata

**File path**: `the_alchemiser/shared/utils/serialization.py`

**Commit SHA / Tag**: `a6d8ae199106b167c994f55cb2c07acbf561a130`

**Reviewer(s)**: Copilot AI Agent

**Date**: 2025-10-06

**Business function / Module**: shared/utils

**Runtime context**: Application boundary serialization (event bus, logging, API responses)

**Criticality**: P2 (Medium) - Utility module used at system boundaries

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```
Internal: None (pure utility)
External: collections.abc (Mapping, Sequence, Set), dataclasses (asdict, is_dataclass), decimal (Decimal), typing (Any, Protocol, cast)
```

**External services touched**:
```
None - Pure transformation utility with no I/O
```

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Consumed: Any Python objects (Pydantic models, dataclasses, Decimals, containers)
Produced: JSON-serializable Python primitives (dict, list, str, int, float, bool, None)
```

**Related docs/specs**:
- Copilot Instructions (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- Structlog Usage (docs/structlog_usage.md)
- Similar serialization in shared.logging.structlog_config.decimal_serializer

---

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None identified.

### High
None identified.

### Medium
None identified. (Previous concern about exception logging reconsidered - see Additional Notes)

### Low
1. **No explicit recursion depth limit** (Lines 33-66): Deep nesting could theoretically cause stack overflow, though Python's default limit (1000) should suffice for typical usage.
2. **Duplication with structlog_config.decimal_serializer** (Lines 33-66): Similar logic exists in `shared.logging.structlog_config.decimal_serializer`. Consider consolidation or documentation of why separate implementations exist.

### Info/Nits
1. **Module docstring is excellent** (Lines 1-12): Clear purpose, constraints, and usage boundaries.
2. **Type hints are complete** (Lines 22-25, 28-30, 33-43, 69-73): All functions properly typed.
3. **Protocol usage is correct** (Lines 22-25): Structural typing for duck-typed model_dump.
4. **Test coverage added**: Comprehensive test suite created with 34 test cases covering edge cases, compliance, and properties.

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - Purpose: JSON-serializable conversion at application boundaries
  - No domain logic, no I/O, no side effects
  
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - All public functions have comprehensive docstrings
  - Policy clearly documented with examples
  
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - All function signatures properly typed
  - `Any` used only in Protocol definition (acceptable for structural typing)
  
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - N/A: This is a utility module, not a DTO definition
  
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - Decimal → str conversion preserves precision
  - No float comparisons in this module
  
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ✓ Defensive fallback at line 51 is acceptable for pure utility (no logging dependency by design)
  - TypeError messages are clear and actionable
  - Exception handler is properly marked with `pragma: no cover`
  
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✓ Pure function: same input → same output
  - No side effects, no state
  
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✓ Fully deterministic: no time, no RNG, no I/O
  
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✓ No secrets, no eval, no dynamic imports
  - Input validation via type checks
  
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ✓ N/A for pure utility module (by design: "intentionally lightweight and have no side effects")
  - Callers are responsible for logging if serialization fails
  
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ✓ **NEW**: Comprehensive test suite added (34 tests)
  - Covers edge cases, compliance, and properties
  
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✓ Pure computation, no I/O
  - Recursion may be stack-intensive for very deep structures (Low risk)
  
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - `to_serializable`: ~33 lines, cyclomatic ~7 (if/elif chains), 1 param ✓
  - `ensure_serialized_dict`: ~14 lines, cyclomatic ~4, 1 param ✓
  - Helper functions: < 5 lines each ✓
  
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✓ 83 lines total (well below limit)

## 5) Additional Notes

### Strengths
1. **Excellent module design**: Single responsibility, clear boundaries, no side effects.
2. **Type safety**: Complete type hints, structural typing via Protocol.
3. **Decimal handling**: Correct precision preservation via string conversion.
4. **Documentation**: Clear docstrings explaining policy and usage constraints.
5. **No external dependencies**: Uses stdlib only for maximum portability.
6. **Defensive programming**: Fallback behavior for model_dump failures.

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Code duplication**: Similar logic exists in `structlog_config.decimal_serializer`. Consider:
   - Consolidating into this module and importing
   - Documenting why separate implementations exist
3. **Recursion depth**: Consider documenting maximum supported nesting depth or adding optional depth limit.

### Recommendations
1. **Document relationship with structlog_config** (Low priority):
   Add note in module docstring explaining:
   - Why this module exists separately from logging serializer
   - When to use each (application boundaries vs logging boundaries)

2. **Add recursion depth documentation** (Low priority):
   Document in `to_serializable` docstring:
   ```
   Note: Recursion depth is limited by Python's default stack limit (~1000).
   For extremely deep structures, consider flattening before serialization.
   ```

### Test Coverage Analysis
- **NEW**: Created comprehensive test suite with 34 tests
- **Coverage areas**:
  - Decimal precision preservation
  - Pydantic model serialization
  - Dataclass serialization
  - Nested structures (dicts, lists, tuples, sets)
  - Edge cases (empty collections, None values, negative numbers)
  - Property-based tests (idempotency, round-trip)
  - Compliance tests (frozen models, type annotations)
- **All tests passing**: ✓
