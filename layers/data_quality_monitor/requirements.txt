# Data Quality Monitor Lambda Layer - Reference Documentation
# ============================================================
# This layer is built via Makefile, NOT pip install from this file.
# The Makefile downloads pre-built awswrangler and adds twelvedata.
#
# INCLUDED FROM AWSWRANGLER LAYER (3.10.0):
#   - awswrangler, pandas, numpy, pyarrow
#   - boto3, botocore, s3transfer (redundant - Lambda runtime provides these)
#   - pydantic, requests, urllib3, certifi
#   - openpyxl, fsspec, and more
#
# NOTE: boto3/botocore are included in awswrangler but not used at runtime.
# Lambda runtime provides boto3/botocore natively. The pre-built awswrangler
# layer includes them, but we cannot exclude them from the downloaded artifact.
#
# ADDED BY MAKEFILE:
#   - twelvedata (for external data validation via Twelve Data API)
#   - structlog, pydantic (shared dependencies)
#
# Total size: ~190MB unzipped (under 250MB Lambda limit)
#
# To update versions, edit layers/data_quality_monitor/Makefile:
#   AWSWRANGLER_VERSION := 3.10.0
#   TWELVEDATA_VERSION := 1.2.17
