**File path**: `the_alchemiser/shared/types/money.py`

**Commit SHA / Tag**: `802cf268358e3299fb6b80a4b7cf3d4bda2994f4`

**Reviewer(s)**: GitHub Copilot

**Date**: 2025-01-06

**Business function / Module**: shared

**Runtime context**: Trading system value object (in-memory operations, no I/O)

**Criticality**: P1 (High) - Core financial primitive used across all modules for money representation

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```python
Internal: None
External: dataclasses (stdlib), decimal (stdlib)
```

**External services touched**: None (pure value object)

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Produced: Money value object (used by portfolio, execution, strategy modules)
Consumed: None
```

**Related docs/specs**:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Core guardrails (Decimal for money, no float operations)
- ISO 4217 currency code standard

---

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None

### High
1. **Missing comprehensive docstrings for operations** - Methods lack pre/post-conditions, failure modes
2. **No subtraction operation** - Common financial operation is missing
3. **No comparison operators** - Cannot compare Money objects (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
4. **Missing divide operation** - Common financial calculation missing
5. **No string representation** - Missing __str__ and __repr__ for debugging/logging
6. **Missing from_string/to_string methods** - No serialization support for persistence

### Medium
7. **Currency validation is naive** - Only checks length, doesn't validate against ISO 4217 codes
8. **No separate exception types** - Uses generic ValueError instead of domain-specific errors
9. **Module header incorrect** - Says "utilities" but should be "shared" per conventions
10. **Precision hardcoded** - 2 decimal places hardcoded, doesn't support currencies like JPY (0 decimals)
11. **No zero factory method** - Common pattern Money.zero("USD") not provided
12. **Type hints could be more specific** - currency could be Literal type or NewType

### Low
13. **No hash implementation** - Cannot use Money in sets/dicts (frozen=True provides it, but not explicit)
14. **Multiplication doesn't validate factor type** - Could accept int/float instead of Decimal
15. **No absolute value method** - Useful for financial calculations

### Info/Nits
16. **Docstring could be more comprehensive** - Missing examples and edge cases
17. **No mention of thread safety** - Though immutable, should be documented
18. **Test coverage pragma comment** - `pragma: no cover` on __post_init__ prevents seeing validation coverage

## 3) Line-by-Line Notes

### Detailed Line-by-Line Analysis

| Line(s) | Issue / Observation | Severity | Evidence / Excerpt | Proposed Action |
|---------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Incorrect business unit in module header | Medium | `"""Business Unit: utilities; Status: current."""` | Change to `"""Business Unit: shared; Status: current."""` |
| 3 | Missing explicit __all__ export | Low | No `__all__` defined | Add `__all__ = ["Money"]` for explicit API |
| 9 | Frozen dataclass provides immutability | Info | `@dataclass(frozen=True)` | Good practice - maintains immutability |
| 11-17 | Class docstring lacks detail | Medium | Missing failure modes, examples | Enhance with pre/post-conditions, examples, edge cases |
| 19 | Amount type hint is correct | Info | `amount: Decimal` | Follows guardrails - Decimal for money |
| 20 | Currency as plain str, not validated | Medium | `currency: str  # ISO 4217 code` | Consider NewType("Currency", str) or Literal type |
| 22 | Pragma comment prevents coverage tracking | Low | `# pragma: no cover` | Remove or justify - validation should be covered |
| 24-25 | Negative amount check | High | Raises ValueError | Good validation, but should use custom exception |
| 26-27 | Currency length check is naive | Medium | `if len(self.currency) != 3` | Doesn't validate actual ISO 4217 codes (e.g., "XXX" passes) |
| 28-29 | Quantization is correct | Info | `quantize(Decimal("0.01"), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)` | Proper use of Decimal, ROUND_HALF_UP appropriate |
| 28 | Hardcoded 2 decimal precision | Medium | `Decimal("0.01")` | Doesn't support 0-decimal currencies (JPY, KRW) or 3-decimal (BHD) |
| 31-35 | Add method is well-implemented | Info | Currency check, returns new Money | Good immutability pattern |
| 32 | Missing comprehensive docstring | High | `"""Add two Money amounts of the same currency."""` | Add raises, examples, edge cases |
| 33-34 | Currency mismatch handling | High | Raises ValueError | Should use domain-specific exception from shared.errors |
| 37-39 | Multiply method is well-implemented | Info | Returns new Money | Good immutability pattern |
| 38 | Missing comprehensive docstring | High | `"""Multiply Money amount by a decimal factor."""` | Add raises, examples, constraints (factor >= 0?) |
| 38 | Factor type not validated | Low | Accepts Decimal but should validate | Could validate factor is Decimal, not int/float |
| N/A | Missing subtract method | High | No subtraction operation | Add `subtract(other: Money) -> Money` method |
| N/A | Missing divide method | High | No division operation | Add `divide(factor: Decimal) -> Money` or `divide_money(divisor: Money) -> Decimal` |
| N/A | Missing comparison operators | High | No ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= | Implement __eq__, __lt__, etc. or use @dataclass(order=True) |
| N/A | Missing string representation | High | No __str__ or __repr__ | Add for debugging/logging: `Money(100.50 USD)` |
| N/A | Missing factory methods | Medium | No zero(), from_string() | Add convenience constructors |
| N/A | Missing absolute value | Low | No abs() method | Add `absolute() -> Money` for consistency |
| N/A | Missing negate method | Low | No negate() | Add `negate() -> Money` for sign flip (even if negative not allowed in constructor) |
| N/A | Missing type checking in operations | Medium | multiply() accepts any type | Add runtime validation: `if not isinstance(factor, Decimal)` |

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP) - Pure value object
- [ ] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes - Missing details
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful) - Could improve currency typing
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types) - Frozen dataclass
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats - Proper Decimal usage
- [ ] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught - Uses generic ValueError
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks - N/A (pure value object)
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic - N/A (deterministic)
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports - Safe
- [ ] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops - N/A (value object, but missing __str__)
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio) - 35 tests, good property-based coverage
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits - N/A (pure computation)
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5 - Simple methods, low complexity
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800 - Only 40 lines
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports - Clean imports

**Overall Score**: 11/15 (73%) - Good foundation but missing key operations and proper error handling

## 5) Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Before Production Use)
1. **Add custom exception types** - Create `MoneyError`, `CurrencyMismatchError` in `shared.errors` or `shared.types.exceptions`
2. **Implement comparison operators** - Add __eq__, __lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__ for Money comparisons
3. **Add subtract method** - Essential financial operation
4. **Implement __str__ and __repr__** - Critical for debugging and logging
5. **Enhance docstrings** - Add pre/post-conditions, failure modes, examples

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
6. **Add divide method** - Common financial calculation
7. **Validate currency against ISO 4217** - Create currency validator or use external library
8. **Support variable precision** - Handle JPY (0 decimals), BHD (3 decimals)
9. **Add factory methods** - Money.zero(currency), Money.from_string()
10. **Type validation in operations** - Ensure Decimal types in multiply/divide

### Medium Priority (Future Enhancement)
11. **Add absolute value method** - Useful for financial calculations
12. **Add negate method** - For symmetry and clarity
13. **Fix module header** - Update business unit to "shared"
14. **Remove pragma comment** - Ensure validation is tested
15. **Add NewType for Currency** - Better type safety

### Testing Enhancements
16. **Add tests for new operations** - subtract, divide, comparisons
17. **Add tests for error cases** - Custom exceptions with proper messages
18. **Add tests for edge cases** - Very large amounts, different currencies
19. **Add serialization tests** - to_string/from_string when implemented

## 6) Additional Notes

### Strengths
- ✅ Proper use of `Decimal` for financial arithmetic (follows guardrails)
- ✅ Immutable design with `frozen=True` prevents accidental modification
- ✅ Good test coverage with property-based tests (Hypothesis)
- ✅ Simple, focused implementation (SRP)
- ✅ Correct rounding strategy (ROUND_HALF_UP)

### Architecture Alignment
- ✅ Located in correct module (`shared/types`)
- ✅ No dependencies on business modules
- ✅ Pure value object with no side effects
- ❌ Should use `shared.errors` for custom exceptions

### Risk Assessment
- **Low immediate risk** - Basic operations work correctly
- **Medium future risk** - Missing operations will require client code workarounds
- **Low maintainability risk** - Simple, well-tested code

### Comparison with Industry Standards
Most financial libraries (e.g., py-moneyed, money) provide:
- ✅ Immutable money objects with currency
- ✅ Basic arithmetic (add, multiply)
- ❌ Subtraction and division operations (missing)
- ❌ Comparison operators (missing)
- ❌ String representation (missing)
- ❌ Currency validation beyond length (missing)
- ❌ Multi-precision support (missing)

## 7) Code Quality Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: 40
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 4 (Low - Good)
- **Test Coverage**: 35 tests covering all existing operations
- **Public API Surface**: 3 methods (add, multiply, __post_init__)
- **Dependencies**: 2 (stdlib only)
- **Mutation Score**: N/A (would benefit from mutation testing)

---

## 8) Conclusion

The `money.py` module provides a **solid foundation** for financial calculations with proper Decimal usage and immutability. However, it is **incomplete** for production use in a trading system.

**Critical gaps**:
1. Missing essential operations (subtract, divide, compare)
2. No custom exception types
3. Limited currency validation
4. Missing string representation for debugging

**Recommendation**: Implement high-priority improvements before expanding usage beyond simple portfolio calculations. The module should be considered **70% complete** for institutional-grade financial software.

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 developer days to address all high-priority items and add comprehensive tests.
