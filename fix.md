Summary

The original Composer strategy allocates 25 % UVXY and 75 % BIL when TQQQ RSI > 79 or SPY RSI > 80 in a bull market
In the Python engine these conditions return only UVXY as a single-symbol hedge without the BIL allocation
The Clojure logic’s bull‑market KMLM switcher allocates TECL if XLK<29 else BIL, but the Python port sends execution to _evaluate_bond_vs_short_selection in this branch
The bear‑market path includes a 15 % UVXY and 85 % BIL mix when UVXY RSI > 84, then proceeds to the same KMLM switcher with a final SQQQ/BSV filter. In the Python engine this becomes UVXY for > 84 and BIL for > 74, losing the mixed allocation.
Assessment

The Python implementation captures the general structure (bull vs. bear regime, RSI thresholds, KMLM comparison, and final SQQQ/BSV filter). However, some details of the Clojure strategy are simplified:

Mixed UVXY/BIL allocations (25/75 in bull regime, 15/85 in bear regime) are replaced with single‑asset signals.
Bull‑market KMLM switcher should return BIL directly when XLK<29, not invoke the bond-vs-short filter.
These differences mean the Python engine isn’t a fully faithful port. To match the Clojure logic, consider:

Allowing TECLStrategyEngine to output multi-asset allocations (e.g., {'UVXY':0.25,'BIL':0.75}) for the overbought hedges.
Removing _evaluate_bond_vs_short_selection from the bull-market branch so that the else case simply returns BIL.
Implementing the UVXY+85%BIL mix in the bear-market volatility check.
