# Legacy DDD Architecture Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive audit of the legacy Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture files under `the_alchemiser/` to determine what can be safely deleted versus what requires migration as part of EPIC #424's modular rework.

**Key Finding:** Out of 307 legacy files analyzed, 51 files (17%) have been successfully deleted with zero risk, while 99 files (32%) have been successfully migrated with systematic business unit alignment.

## Audit Methodology

### Scope
Analyzed legacy DDD directories:
- `application/` - Service abstractions and application layer  
- `domain/` - DDD domain models, strategies, protocols
- `infrastructure/` - Adapters, config, dependency injection
- `interfaces/` - CLI and schemas  
- `services/` - Repository, trading, shared services

### Analysis Approach
1. **Static Analysis**: Examined file content for DDD patterns vs business logic
2. **Import Dependency Analysis**: Found active imports across entire codebase
3. **Equivalence Mapping**: Cross-referenced with new modular structure
4. **Risk Assessment**: Categorized by deletion safety and impact

- Estimated remaining time: 1-2 weeks for non-critical path files

### Phase 3: Manual Investigation

**Status**: Not started  
**Files**: 177 uncertain files  
**Risk**: HIGH  
**Estimated time**: 4-6 weeks  

**Approach:**
1. Manual code review for business value
2. Determine if logic exists in new modules
3. Extract any missing business logic
4. Update architecture documentation

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Deletions (96 files total)
- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ 51 orphaned files COMPLETED
- **DDD ceremony with equivalents**: 23 files (pending)
- **Additional safe files**: 11 files (identified post-deletion)
- **Impact**: Cleanup only, no functional changes

### Medium Risk Changes (81 files)
- **Compatibility shims with imports**: Need import updates
- **Configuration files**: May affect runtime behavior  
- **Impact**: Requires coordination with development

### High Risk Changes (141 files)
- **Business logic**: Risk of losing functionality
- **Core infrastructure**: May break system integration
- **Impact**: Requires careful analysis and testing

## Safety Mechanisms

### Implemented Safeguards
1. **Comprehensive Import Analysis**: Verified no external dependencies for safe deletions
2. **Incremental Testing**: Tested approach with 10 files successfully
3. **Backup Strategy**: All changes in version control with easy rollback
4. **Documentation**: Detailed mapping of legacy ‚Üí new structure

### Recommended Safeguards
1. **Branch Protection**: Perform all deletions in feature branches
2. **Automated Testing**: Run full test suite after each phase
3. **Smoke Testing**: Verify CLI and core functionality
4. **Staged Rollout**: Delete files in small batches with verification

## Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1 Rollback
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- the_alchemiser/application/
git checkout HEAD~1 -- the_alchemiser/domain/
# Restore specific deleted files as needed
```

### Import Migration Rollback
1. Revert individual commits for each file migration
2. Restore legacy imports if new structure causes issues
3. Use compatibility shims as temporary bridges

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
git reset --hard <baseline_commit>
# Complete rollback to pre-audit state
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1-2: Complete Phase 1
- [ ] Delete remaining 52 safe files
- [ ] Verify system stability
- [ ] Update documentation

### Week 3-6: Phase 2 Migration  
- [ ] Map all import dependencies
- [ ] Update CLI imports to new modules
- [ ] Migrate core execution components
- [ ] Delete migrated legacy files

### Week 7-12: Phase 3 Investigation
- [ ] Analyze uncertain files manually
- [ ] Extract missing business logic
- [ ] Complete architecture cleanup
- [ ] Update team documentation

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- [ ] Reduce legacy file count from 307 to <50
- [ ] Eliminate all "Status: legacy" shims
- [ ] Maintain 0 new test failures
- [ ] Keep lint error count stable

### Qualitative Goals  
- [ ] Clear modular architecture boundaries
- [ ] No legacy import paths remaining
- [ ] Documentation reflects clean structure
- [ ] Team confidence in new architecture

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Approve Phase 1**: Safe to proceed with 52 remaining deletions
2. **Prioritize CLI Fix**: Address broken imports blocking migration testing
3. **Create Migration Tools**: Scripts to update import statements

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Legacy Sunset Timeline**: Set firm deadline for completing cleanup
2. **New Feature Freeze**: Only develop in new modular structure
3. **Documentation Update**: Reflect new architecture in all docs

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Incremental Approach**: Never delete more than 10 files without testing
2. **Team Communication**: Coordinate with active development
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for performance or functionality regressions

## Conclusion

The audit successfully identified a clear path to safely remove 20% of legacy DDD files immediately, with a structured approach for migrating the remaining active components. The modular rework is sufficiently mature to support this cleanup effort.

**Next Steps:**
1. Proceed with Phase 1 safe deletions
2. Begin systematic import migration for Phase 2
3. Allocate resources for Phase 3 manual investigation

This cleanup effort will significantly simplify the codebase and establish clear architectural boundaries as intended by EPIC #424.
