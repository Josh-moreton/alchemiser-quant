## 0) Metadata

**File path**: `the_alchemiser/shared/value_objects/__init__.py`

**Commit SHA / Tag**: `a6d8ae199106b167c994f55cb2c07acbf561a130`

**Reviewer(s)**: @copilot (Automated AI Review)

**Date**: 2025-10-06

**Business function / Module**: shared / value_objects

**Runtime context**: Module-level imports only; no runtime execution context

**Criticality**: P2 (Medium) - Core value objects used across all modules

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```
Internal: 
  - .core_types (18 TypedDict definitions + 1 Literal type)
  - .symbol (Symbol value object)
External: None (pure Python)
```

**External services touched**: None - Pure value object definitions

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Exported types (19 total):
  - Symbol (immutable value object)
  - AccountInfo, EnrichedAccountInfo (account data)
  - PositionInfo, PositionsDict, PortfolioSnapshot (portfolio data)
  - OrderDetails, OrderStatusLiteral (order data)
  - StrategySignal, StrategySignalBase, StrategyPnLSummary (strategy data)
  - MarketDataPoint, IndicatorData, PriceData, QuoteData (market data)
  - TradeAnalysis (trade analytics)
  - ErrorContext (error reporting)
  - KLMDecision (KLM variant decisions)

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- ✅ Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- ✅ Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- ✅ Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- ✅ Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- ✅ Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None identified.

### High
**H1**: Missing `identifier.py` export in `__all__` list - The `Identifier` value object is not exported but is used in production code (see `error_handler.py`).

### Medium
**M1**: TypedDict types in core_types.py use `str | float` for monetary values, which violates the "No floats for money" guardrail from Copilot Instructions. These should use `Decimal` instead.

**M2**: No version information or schema versioning for DTOs - TypedDict definitions lack versioning metadata which could cause issues during schema evolution.

### Low
**L1**: Module docstring could be more specific about the distinction between TypedDict (core_types) and immutable value objects (Symbol, Identifier).

**L2**: Import order: While following stdlib → third-party → local convention, the relative imports could have a comment explaining the architectural boundary.

### Info/Nits
**I1**: The `__all__` list is manually maintained and could get out of sync if new exports are added to submodules.

**I2**: No explicit test coverage for the `__init__.py` file itself (import correctness).

## 3) Line-by-Line Notes

### Detailed Line-by-Line Analysis

| Line(s) | Issue / Observation | Severity | Evidence / Excerpt | Proposed Action |
|---------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1-6 | Module docstring | Low | `"""Common value objects and types.\n\nBusiness Unit: shared \| Status: current\n\nCore value objects and type definitions used across modules.\n"""` | Consider adding note distinguishing TypedDict vs immutable value objects |
| 8 | Future annotations import | ✅ Good | `from __future__ import annotations` | Enables forward references, required for Python 3.12 |
| 10-29 | Import from core_types | Medium | Imports 18 types including `AccountInfo`, `PositionInfo` with `str \| float` fields | See M1: Monetary fields use float instead of Decimal |
| 30 | Import Symbol | ✅ Good | `from .symbol import Symbol` | Symbol is properly exported and immutable |
| 32-52 | `__all__` list | High | Missing `Identifier` export; list is manually maintained | See H1: Identifier not exported but used in error_handler.py |
| - | Missing Identifier import | High | `identifier.py` exists but not imported/exported | Add import and export of Identifier |

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Single purpose: Re-export value objects and types for consumption by other modules
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ✅ Module-level docstring present; N/A for exports (delegated to source modules)
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ All exports are properly typed (Symbol is a dataclass, TypedDicts are explicitly typed)
  - ⚠️ Note: `Any` appears in TypedDict definitions (e.g., `dict[str, Any]`) which is acceptable for flexible DTOs
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - ⚠️ Symbol is frozen (dataclass with `frozen=True`)
  - ⚠️ TypedDicts are NOT frozen - they are mutable dictionaries by design
  - ⚠️ For true immutability, consider migrating to Pydantic models (future work)
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ❌ VIOLATION: `AccountInfo`, `PositionInfo`, `OrderDetails` use `str | float` for monetary values
  - ❌ See core_types.py lines 30-38 (equity, cash, buying_power, etc.)
  - ✅ Symbol validation is correct (string-based, no numeric issues)
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ✅ N/A - This is a pure import/export module with no error handling logic
  - ✅ Symbol validation raises `ValueError` with descriptive messages (in symbol.py)
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✅ N/A - No handlers or side-effects in this module
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ N/A - No time-dependent or random behavior in this module
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No security concerns; uses static relative imports only
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ✅ N/A - No logging in this module (import/export only)
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ✅ Symbol has comprehensive tests (40 tests, 100% passing)
  - ⚠️ No explicit test for __init__.py import correctness
  - ⚠️ TypedDicts lack property-based validation tests
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ N/A - Pure module-level imports, no runtime performance impact
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ File is 52 lines total; no functions/classes; trivial complexity
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ 52 lines - well within limits
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ No wildcard imports
  - ✅ Only relative imports from sibling modules (`.core_types`, `.symbol`)
  - ✅ Proper import order (stdlib → local)

## 5) Additional Notes

### Architecture Compliance

✅ **Module Boundaries**: This file correctly follows the shared module pattern:
- No imports from `strategy_v2/`, `portfolio_v2/`, `execution_v2/` (correct - shared is a leaf module)
- Only exports to other modules (correct - provides shared types)
- Uses relative imports within `shared/value_objects/` package (correct)

### Usage Patterns Identified

The following modules import from `shared.value_objects`:
1. **Symbol**: 9 imports across strategy, brokers, services, protocols, adapters
2. **core_types**: 5 imports for AccountInfo, PositionInfo, OrderDetails, StrategyPnLSummary, MarketDataPoint
3. **Identifier**: 1 import in error_handler.py (but NOT exported in __all__ - **BUG H1**)

### Migration Context

Per `core_types.py` docstring: "Interface/UI types have been moved to interfaces/schemas modules as part of the Pydantic migration."

This indicates an ongoing migration from TypedDict → Pydantic models. Current state:
- TypedDict still used for core domain types (backward compatibility)
- Pydantic models used for interfaces/schemas (modern approach)
- Symbol is a frozen dataclass (immutable value object - correct pattern)

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (Required)
1. **Fix H1**: Add `Identifier` to imports and `__all__` list
2. **Fix M1**: Create migration plan for monetary fields to use `Decimal` instead of `str | float`

#### Short-term (Next Sprint)
3. **Address M2**: Add schema versioning to TypedDict definitions using TypedDict metadata or migration to Pydantic
4. **Add L2**: Document why TypedDict is still used vs Pydantic models

#### Long-term (Strategic)
5. Complete migration from TypedDict → Pydantic models for all DTOs (already in progress per core_types.py comments)
6. Add property-based tests for TypedDict validation (hypothesis)
7. Consider adding a test module that validates `__all__` exports match actual exports

### Financial-Grade Assessment

**Overall Grade**: B+ (Good with correctable issues)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Clear single responsibility
- ✅ Proper module boundaries respected
- ✅ Symbol value object is well-designed (immutable, validated, tested)
- ✅ No security concerns
- ✅ Manageable size and complexity

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Missing export (H1 - critical for production code)
- ❌ Monetary values using float (M1 - violates financial guardrails)
- ⚠️ TypedDict mutability (by design, but risky)
- ⚠️ No schema versioning (M2)

**Production Readiness**: CONDITIONAL
- Can be used in production AFTER fixing H1 (missing Identifier export)
- Should plan migration for M1 (float → Decimal for money) in next release
- Current monetary value handling is a technical debt item
