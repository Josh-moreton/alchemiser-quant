Summary

The test suite lists various market scenarios in tests/test_telegram_bot.py from lines 8‑157. Each scenario specifies expected actions and symbols for conditions such as SPY/IOO overbought, oversold signals, bull market nuclear allocations, and several bear‑market setups

Overbought strategy logic in core/strategy_engine.py returns UVXY when RSI > 81 for certain indexes, and otherwise returns UVXY_BTAL_PORTFOLIO (75% UVXY, 25% BTAL)

The Clojure strategy (scripts/composer_trade_scripts/Nuclear.clj) shows the same default to a “UVXY 75|25 BTAL” group when none of the overbought checks exceed 81

Findings

Missing coverage of the UVXY/BTAL portfolio.

Scenario multiple_overbought_uvxy_btal expects symbol "UVXY" (line 39). However, both the Clojure script and the Python strategy return the combined UVXY_BTAL_PORTFOLIO in this case. The test should validate that the bot emits the portfolio signal (two alerts) rather than a single UVXY alert.

No tests for Bear Portfolio allocation.

If _bear_subgroup_1 and _bear_subgroup_2 produce different symbols, BearMarketStrategy can return 'BEAR_PORTFOLIO' with inverse‑volatility weights. The suite only checks for single symbols (TQQQ or SQQQ) and never simulates a case where the two subgroups disagree.

Outcomes QQQ and PSQ not tested.

_bear_subgroup_1 can return PSQ or QQQ depending on QQQ weakness and bond strength. The test scenarios never expect those symbols, so the code paths generating them remain unverified.

No scenario uses the default HOLD action.

evaluate_nuclear_strategy falls back to ("SPY", "HOLD", "No clear signal…") if no handler triggers. All defined scenarios force a BUY outcome, so HOLD behavior is untested.

Recommendation

Add additional scenarios to cover:

Overbought case with no RSI above 81 to confirm the UVXY_BTAL_PORTFOLIO result.

Bear-market situations where subgroup 1 and subgroup 2 disagree, producing a BEAR_PORTFOLIO with weighted allocations.

Situations leading to PSQ or QQQ recommendations.

A neutral scenario yielding the default HOLD signal.

This will ensure the test suite exercises every possible branch of the strategy logic defined in Nuclear.clj and implemented in the Python bot.
