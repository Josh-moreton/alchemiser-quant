## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - **Status**: ✅ Perfect. Pure module interface exposing adapters for strategy consumption.
  
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - No functions/classes defined (interface only). Submodules have proper docs.
  
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - No function signatures in interface file. Submodules properly typed.
  
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - No DTOs defined in this file.
  
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - No numerical operations in this file.
  
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - No error handling needed in module interface.
  
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - No handlers or side effects.
  
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - No business logic; pure imports.
  
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - **Status**: ✅ Verified with Bandit. No security issues. No secrets, eval, exec, or dangerous operations.
  
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - Interface file; no logging needed.
  
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - **Status**: ✅ NEW - Comprehensive test suite created (`tests/strategy_v2/adapters/test_init.py`). 19 tests, 100% pass rate.
  
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - **Status**: ✅ N/A - No I/O or performance concerns in interface.
  
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - **Status**: ✅ Exemplary. Zero functions, zero complexity. 18 lines total.
  
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - **Status**: ✅ Exemplary. 18 lines (target ≤ 500, hard limit ≤ 800).
  
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - **Status**: ✅ Perfect. No wildcard imports. Clean relative imports from submodules.

## 6) Architecture & Design

### Module Purpose
**Status**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

The file serves as a clean public interface for the strategy_v2 adapters submodule. It explicitly exports:
1. `FeaturePipeline` - Feature computation for market data
2. `MarketDataProvider` - Protocol for data provider implementations
3. `StrategyMarketDataAdapter` - Concrete adapter for Alpaca market data

### Boundary Compliance
**Status**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

```python
# Import hierarchy verified:
strategy_v2/adapters/__init__.py
├── imports from: .feature_pipeline (same package)
├── imports from: .market_data_adapter (same package)
└── no cross-module imports ✓
```

The module correctly:
- Uses relative imports from its own package
- Does NOT import from other business modules (portfolio_v2, execution_v2)
- Does NOT import from orchestration
- Properly imports from shared (via submodules)

### Interface Design
**Status**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

The `__all__` declaration is explicit and complete:
```python
__all__ = [
    "FeaturePipeline",
    "MarketDataProvider",
    "StrategyMarketDataAdapter",
]
```

This provides:
- Clear public API contract
- IDE autocomplete support
- Import clarity for consumers
- No pollution of importing namespace

---

## 7) Usage Analysis

### Internal Usage
The exported classes are used by:
1. `strategy_v2/core/factory.py` - Creates StrategyMarketDataAdapter instances
2. `strategy_v2/core/orchestrator.py` - Consumes StrategyMarketDataAdapter
3. Strategy engines - Use FeaturePipeline for indicator calculations

### Import Pattern
```python
# Proper usage (from strategy_v2 modules):
from ..adapters.market_data_adapter import StrategyMarketDataAdapter

# Or via package interface:
from the_alchemiser.strategy_v2.adapters import (
    FeaturePipeline,
    StrategyMarketDataAdapter
)
```

**Status**: ✅ All usage patterns are correct and follow architecture boundaries.
