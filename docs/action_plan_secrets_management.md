# Secrets Management Action Plan

## Objective
Mitigate exposure of sensitive credentials and enforce secure configuration handling across the project.

## Key Tasks
1. **Sanitize Repository**
   - Remove real AWS account IDs, email addresses, and any other secrets from `config.yaml` and commit history.
   - Replace them with placeholder values and store actual credentials via environment variables.
2. **Provide Environment Template**
   - Create `.env.example` illustrating required variables such as `ALPACA_KEY`, `ALPACA_SECRET`, and any AWS credentials.
   - Document usage of `python-dotenv` in the README for local development.
3. **Integrate Secret Loading**
   - Update configuration loader to read from environment variables first, falling back to config files when necessary.
   - Ensure that sensitive values are never logged or printed.
4. **Secure Storage**
   - Utilize AWS Secrets Manager or a similar service for production deployments.
   - Add instructions for retrieving secrets at runtime, avoiding hardcoded values.
5. **Validation**
   - Add unit tests verifying that the application fails gracefully when required environment variables are missing.
   - Include a pre-commit check preventing accidental commits of `.env` files.

## Deliverables
- Sanitized `config.yaml` without personal data.
- New `.env.example` file and updated documentation.
- Refactored configuration loader with secure secret handling.
- Tests covering secret loading and failure modes.
