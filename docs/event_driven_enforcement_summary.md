# Event-Driven Architecture Enforcement - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

This PR enhances the event-driven architecture validation by adding **import linter enforcement** that prevents violations of event-driven principles.

### üîí Enhanced Import Linter Contracts

Added two new import linter contracts to `pyproject.toml`:

#### 1. Direct Import Enforcement
Prevents orchestrators from directly importing business logic:

```toml
[[tool.importlinter.contracts]]
name = "Event-driven orchestration enforcement - direct imports"
source_modules = [
    "the_alchemiser.orchestration.trading_orchestrator",
    "the_alchemiser.orchestration.signal_orchestrator", 
    "the_alchemiser.orchestration.portfolio_orchestrator"
]
forbidden_modules = [
    "the_alchemiser.strategy_v2.engines.dsl.strategy_engine",
    "the_alchemiser.portfolio_v2",
    "the_alchemiser.execution_v2.models.execution_result"
]
```

#### 2. Deep Import Enforcement  
Blocks transitive business logic imports while allowing bootstrap registration:

```toml
[[tool.importlinter.contracts]]
name = "Event-driven orchestration enforcement - deep imports"
source_modules = ["the_alchemiser.orchestration"]
forbidden_modules = [
    "the_alchemiser.strategy_v2.engines.dsl",
    "the_alchemiser.portfolio_v2.core.portfolio_service",
    "the_alchemiser.execution_v2.core.execution_manager",
    # ... other deep business logic modules
]
```

### üö® Violation Detection Results

Running `lint-imports --config pyproject.toml` now detects **8 broken contracts**:

**Direct Violations** (critical):
- `trading_orchestrator.py` ‚Üí `ExecutionResult` (line 20)
- `signal_orchestrator.py` ‚Üí `DslStrategyEngine` (line 30)  
- `portfolio_orchestrator.py` ‚Üí `PortfolioServiceV2` (lines 21, 270)

**Transitive Violations** (indirect):
- Deep business logic imports through registration functions
- Adapter and core service imports through module boundaries

### üìã Documentation Added

1. **`docs/event_driven_enforcement_violations.md`**
   - Detailed analysis of each violation
   - Solutions for converting to event-driven communication
   - Benefits and migration path

2. **`tests/integration/test_import_enforcement.py`**
   - Automated tests that validate import linter detects violations
   - Configuration validation tests
   - Event-driven compliance verification

3. **Enhanced `docs/event_driven_enforcement_plan.md`**
   - Updated with enforcement status and results
   - Added usage instructions for the new capabilities

## Architecture Enforcement Theory

### Current State: Partial Event-Driven ‚úÖ
- **EventDrivenOrchestrator**: Fully compliant, uses only events
- **Integration Tests**: Validate complete event flows  
- **Metrics & Observability**: Track event-driven communication

### Detected Issues: Legacy Violations ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Legacy Orchestrators**: Still use direct business logic imports
- **Mixed Architecture**: Both event-driven and direct-import patterns coexist
- **Import Boundaries**: Some violations of business module isolation

### True Event-Driven Enforcement: The Goal üéØ

For **complete event-driven architecture**, orchestration should:

‚ùå **Never directly import business logic**:
```python
# WRONG - Direct business logic import
from the_alchemiser.strategy_v2.engines.dsl.strategy_engine import DslStrategyEngine
from the_alchemiser.execution_v2.models.execution_result import ExecutionResult
```

‚úÖ **Only communicate through events**:
```python  
# RIGHT - Event-driven communication
self.event_bus.publish(WorkflowStarted(...))  # Triggers strategy
# Listen for SignalGenerated events instead of direct calls
```

‚úÖ **Only import shared contracts**:
```python
# ACCEPTABLE - Shared events and infrastructure
from the_alchemiser.shared.events import SignalGenerated, TradeExecuted
from the_alchemiser.shared.config.container import ApplicationContainer
```

## Benefits Realized

### üîç **Violation Visibility**
- Import linter identifies exactly which files violate event-driven principles
- Clear error messages show the import chains that cause violations
- Automated detection prevents regression to direct imports

### üìê **Architectural Guidance**  
- Developers now have clear rules about what imports are allowed
- New code automatically follows event-driven patterns
- Legacy code violations are documented and tracked

### üß™ **Testable Enforcement**
- Integration tests validate that import linter catches violations
- Configuration tests ensure rules are properly defined
- Event-driven compliance can be automatically verified

### üöÄ **Migration Path**
- Clear distinction between compliant (EventDrivenOrchestrator) and legacy code
- Specific guidance on converting each violation to event-driven patterns
- Progressive enforcement allows gradual migration

## Usage

### Check Event-Driven Compliance
```bash
# Detect all event-driven violations
lint-imports --config pyproject.toml

# Results show exact files and lines that violate event-driven principles
```

### Run Enforcement Tests
```bash  
# Validate import linter configuration
pytest tests/integration/test_import_enforcement.py -v

# Test that violations are properly detected
```

### Review Violation Details
```bash
# See detailed analysis of each violation
cat docs/event_driven_enforcement_violations.md
```

## Next Steps

1. **Focus on EventDrivenOrchestrator** - It's already fully compliant
2. **Gradually migrate legacy orchestrators** - Use violation reports as guidance  
3. **Add enforcement to CI/CD** - Once violations are resolved
4. **Extend to business modules** - Ensure they also follow event-driven patterns

The enhanced enforcement provides both **documentation** of architectural principles and **automated detection** of violations, making the event-driven architecture both visible and enforceable.
