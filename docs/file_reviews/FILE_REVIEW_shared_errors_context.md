  - typing (stdlib) - Type annotations
  - pydantic - Runtime validation and immutability
```

**External services touched**:
```
None - Pure data structure module with no I/O
```

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Produced: ErrorContextData (Pydantic BaseModel v2)
  - Used by: shared/errors/error_handler.py
  - Consumed by: Error handling and notification systems

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None identified.

### High
None identified.

### Medium

1. **NON-DETERMINISTIC TIMESTAMP**: Line 101 generates timestamps using `datetime.now(UTC)` via lambda in Field default_factory. This creates non-deterministic behavior in tests and makes idempotent error handling difficult. Recommendation: Consider providing explicit timestamp parameter or use dependency injection for time source.

2. **MISSING SCHEMA VERSION**: Unlike `shared/schemas/errors.py` DTOs which include explicit `schema_version: Literal["1.0"]` fields, this DTO lacks explicit schema versioning. This makes it harder to track compatibility and migrations in event-driven architecture.

### Low

1. **LEGACY FIELD CONFUSION**: Lines 83-88 include `module` and `function` fields marked as "legacy" with recommendation to use `component` and `function_name` instead. This creates potential confusion for developers. The fields are retained for backward compatibility but may accumulate tech debt.

2. **FIELD OPTIONALITY**: All fields except `additional_data` and `timestamp` are optional (default=None). While this provides flexibility, it reduces type safety and makes it harder to enforce that critical context like `correlation_id` is provided where required by event-driven architecture.

### Info/Nits

1. **COMPREHENSIVE DOCSTRING**: Lines 20-54 provide excellent documentation with examples, field descriptions, and usage patterns. This exceeds project standards.

2. **PROPER IMMUTABILITY**: Line 58 correctly uses `frozen=True` ensuring ErrorContextData instances are immutable, meeting DTO requirements.

3. **CLEAN STRUCTURE**: File is well-organized at 112 lines (well under 500-line soft limit and 800-line hard limit).

## 5) Additional Notes

### Consolidation Success

This file represents the **successful consolidation** of three previous ErrorContextData implementations:

1. **Previous `shared/utils/context.py`** (DELETED) - Had different field names, was unused
2. **Previous dataclass version** - Lacked Pydantic validation
3. **TypedDict version in `shared/schemas/errors.py`** (DEPRECATED) - Less type-safe

The current implementation:
- ✅ Combines best features from all versions
- ✅ Uses Pydantic v2 for runtime validation
- ✅ Includes both event tracing fields (correlation_id, causation_id)
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with legacy fields
- ✅ Has comprehensive test coverage

### Timestamp Non-Determinism

The timestamp field (line 101) uses `datetime.now(UTC)` which creates challenges:

**Impact:**
- Makes it difficult to write deterministic tests
- Two ErrorContextData instances created at different microseconds will differ
- Complicates idempotency checks in event handlers

**Current Test Approach:**
Tests in `tests/shared/errors/test_context.py` verify timestamp field exists but don't assert exact values.

**Recommendation:**
Consider one of these approaches:
1. Make timestamp an optional parameter (default to now() if not provided)
2. Use dependency injection for time source
3. Document that tests should use freezegun for deterministic timestamps
4. Add helper factory function that accepts explicit timestamp

### Schema Versioning

Other DTOs in `shared/schemas/errors.py` include explicit `schema_version: Literal["1.0"]` fields:
- ErrorDetailInfo (line 158)
- ErrorSummaryData (line 206)
- ErrorReportSummary (line 270)
- ErrorNotificationData (line 355)

ErrorContextData lacks this field, making it harder to track compatibility in event-driven workflows.

**Recommendation:**
Add `schema_version: Literal["1.0"] = Field(default="1.0", description="Schema version for compatibility tracking")` for consistency.

### Field Usage Patterns

Based on code review and test coverage:

**Most Used Fields:**
- `correlation_id` - Critical for event tracing
- `operation` - Describes what was being done
- `module`/`component` - Where error occurred
- `additional_data` - Flexible context storage

**Rarely Used Fields:**
- `causation_id` - Usually stored in additional_data (see test line 64)
- `request_id`, `session_id` - Only for HTTP/session contexts
- `function_name`/`function` - Often omitted in favor of operation

This suggests the core required fields for event-driven architecture are:
- correlation_id (or causation_id)
- operation
- component (or module)
- additional_data

### Security Assessment

✅ **No security vulnerabilities identified**

The module:
- Contains no secrets or sensitive data
- Uses Pydantic validation which prevents injection attacks
- Has no I/O or external service calls
- Uses frozen=True preventing mutation attacks
- Uses extra="forbid" preventing unexpected field injection

### Performance Assessment

✅ **No performance concerns**

The module:
- Is a pure data model with no computation
- Uses efficient Pydantic v2 which is Rust-accelerated
- Has minimal memory footprint
- No hot loop usage identified
- Serialization via to_dict() is O(n) where n = number of populated fields

### Determinism Fix Options

If deterministic timestamps are required:

**Option A: Optional timestamp parameter**
```python
timestamp: str = Field(
    default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(UTC).isoformat(),
    description="ISO 8601 timestamp when error context was created",
)
```
→ Change to:
```python
timestamp: str | None = Field(
    default=None,
    description="ISO 8601 timestamp when error context was created",
)

def __post_init__(self):
    if self.timestamp is None:
        object.__setattr__(self, 'timestamp', datetime.now(UTC).isoformat())
```

**Option B: Factory function**
```python
def create_error_context(
    *,
    correlation_id: str | None = None,
    timestamp: str | None = None,
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> ErrorContextData:
    """Create ErrorContextData with optional explicit timestamp."""
    if timestamp is None:
        timestamp = datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
    return ErrorContextData(
        correlation_id=correlation_id,
        timestamp=timestamp,
        **kwargs,
    )
```

**Option C: Time provider dependency injection**
```python
from typing import Callable

TimeProvider = Callable[[], str]

def _default_time_provider() -> str:
    return datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()

class ErrorContextData(BaseModel):
    # ...fields...
    
    @classmethod
    def create(
        cls,
        *,
        time_provider: TimeProvider = _default_time_provider,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> "ErrorContextData":
        """Create ErrorContextData with injectable time source."""
        return cls(timestamp=time_provider(), **kwargs)
```

### Comparison with Other DTOs

ErrorContextData is **more permissive** than other DTOs in the system:

| DTO | Required Fields | Optional Fields | Schema Version |
|-----|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| ErrorDetailInfo | 7 | 2 | ✅ Yes (1.0) |
| ErrorSummaryData | 1 | 1 | ✅ Yes (1.0) |
| ErrorReportSummary | 0 | 7 | ✅ Yes (1.0) |
| ErrorNotificationData | 7 | 2 | ✅ Yes (1.0) |
| **ErrorContextData** | **2** (additional_data, timestamp) | **10** | ❌ No |

This design choice provides flexibility but reduces type safety guarantees.

## 6) Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Medium Issues (Recommended for v2.21.0)

1. **Add Schema Version Field**
   ```python
   schema_version: Literal["1.0"] = Field(
       default="1.0",
       description="Schema version for compatibility tracking",
   )
   ```
   - Location: After line 103, before to_dict() method
   - Rationale: Consistency with other DTOs, enables migration tracking
   - Breaking Change: No (defaults to "1.0")

2. **Document Timestamp Non-Determinism**
   ```python
   # In class docstring
   Note:
       The timestamp field is auto-generated using datetime.now(UTC). For
       deterministic testing, either provide an explicit timestamp or use
       freezegun to freeze time during tests.
   ```
   - Location: Lines 40-42 in class docstring
   - Rationale: Helps developers understand testing implications

### Priority 2: Low Issues (Consider for v3.0.0)

1. **Deprecate Legacy Fields**
   - Add deprecation warnings to `module` and `function` fields
   - Plan removal for v3.0.0
   - Update error_handler.py to use `component` and `function_name`

2. **Consider Required Fields**
   - Evaluate making `correlation_id` required for event-driven contexts
   - Could use discriminated unions (typing.Literal) to enforce field combinations

### Priority 3: Documentation (v2.21.0)

1. **Add Field Usage Guidelines**
   - Document when to use `component` vs `module`
   - Document when to use `function_name` vs `function`
   - Provide migration guide from legacy fields

2. **Add Test Determinism Example**
   - Show how to use freezegun in tests
   - Show how to provide explicit timestamps
   - Document in tests/shared/errors/test_context.py

### Non-Actions (Explicitly Not Recommended)

1. ❌ **Don't make timestamp truly required** - Default factory is appropriate
2. ❌ **Don't remove legacy fields yet** - Backward compatibility is important
3. ❌ **Don't change to dataclass** - Pydantic validation is valuable
4. ❌ **Don't add complex validation logic** - Keep data models simple
