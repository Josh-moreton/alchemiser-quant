**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```
Internal: None
External: None (__future__ only)
```

**External services touched**:
```
None - Pure resource package marker
```

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Provides:
  - Package namespace for bundled JSON configuration files
  - Used by importlib.resources to locate strategy.dev.json and strategy.prod.json
Consumed by:
  - the_alchemiser.shared.config.config.StrategySettings._get_stage_profile()
```

**Related docs/specs**:
- Copilot Instructions (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- Alchemiser Architecture (README.md)
- Strategy configuration loader (the_alchemiser/shared/config/config.py)
- pyproject.toml (package includes directive for *.json files)

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- ✅ Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- ✅ Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- ✅ Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- ✅ Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- ✅ Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

---

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
**None identified** ✅

### High
**None identified** ✅

### Medium
**None identified** ✅

### Low
1. **No explicit `__all__` declaration** - While not strictly required for a resource package, explicit exports improve API clarity
2. **No tests specifically for this package marker** - While the package is indirectly tested via strategy loader tests, explicit tests would document intent

### Info/Nits
1. **File is minimal by design** - This is actually a strength (KISS principle) ✅
2. **Module serves single purpose** - Acts purely as a resource package marker for importlib.resources ✅
3. **Could add version information to docstring** - Following DTOs pattern would make evolution tracking easier

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Purpose: Package marker for bundled JSON configuration assets
  - ✅ Single concern: Resource package namespace definition
  - ✅ No business logic or side effects
  
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ✅ Module-level docstring present and clear
  - N/A - No functions or classes to document
  
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)

  - N/A - No error handling needed (pure package marker)
  - ✅ Error handling happens at the consumer level (StrategySettings._get_stage_profile)
  
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✅ No side effects (pure package marker)
  - ✅ Importing this module multiple times is safe
  
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - N/A - No business logic in this file
  
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No security concerns
  - ✅ No dynamic imports
  - ✅ No eval/exec usage
  - ✅ JSON files in this package do not contain secrets
  
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - N/A - No logging needed (pure package marker)
  
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ⚠️ No direct tests found for this `__init__.py`
  - ✅ Package functionality is tested indirectly via:
    - `tests/shared/config/test_strategy_loader.py::test_strategy_loader_uses_dev_packaged_defaults`
    - `tests/shared/config/test_strategy_loader.py::test_strategy_loader_uses_prod_packaged_defaults`
  - ℹ️ Recommendation: Add explicit import test to verify package is correctly marked
  
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - N/A - No I/O operations (pure package marker)
  - ✅ No performance concerns
  
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ Cyclomatic complexity: 0 (no branches)
  - ✅ Cognitive complexity: 0 (no logic)
  - ✅ No functions
  
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ 5 lines (well below any limit)
  
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ No imports (except implicit __future__ in Python)
  - ✅ No import ordering concerns

## 5) Additional Notes

### Purpose & Architecture
This file serves as a **resource package marker** for bundled configuration assets. It follows the [importlib.resources](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html) pattern, which is the modern Python approach for accessing non-code files in packages.

### How It Works
1. The `pyproject.toml` includes this directive:
   ```toml
   include = [
       { path = "the_alchemiser/config/*.json", format = "sdist" },
       { path = "the_alchemiser/config/*.json", format = "wheel" }
   ]
   ```
2. JSON files (`strategy.dev.json`, `strategy.prod.json`) are bundled alongside this `__init__.py`
3. Consumer code uses `importlib.resources.files("the_alchemiser.config")` to locate these files
4. This works correctly in AWS Lambda deployments where file paths may differ

### Design Strengths
- ✅ **Minimal by design**: No logic means no bugs
- ✅ **Follows Python best practices**: Uses importlib.resources pattern correctly
- ✅ **Well-documented**: Docstring explains purpose and loading mechanism
- ✅ **Compliant with standards**: Matches Copilot Instructions module header format
- ✅ **Separation of concerns**: Configuration data separate from configuration logic

### Consumer Contract
The contract with consumers is:
- **Package name**: `"the_alchemiser.config"`
- **Contents**: JSON files with deterministic names (`strategy.<stage>.json`)
- **Schema**: JSON objects with `"files"` and `"allocations"` keys (validated by StrategySettings)

### Testing Strategy
While there are no direct tests for this `__init__.py`, the package is effectively tested through:
1. **Integration tests**: `test_strategy_loader.py` verifies packaged configs can be loaded
2. **Build validation**: Package inclusion is validated by Poetry during build
3. **Runtime validation**: JSON schema validation happens in StrategySettings

A minimal test could be added for documentation purposes:
```python
def test_config_package_is_importable():
    """Verify the_alchemiser.config package can be imported and used with importlib.resources."""
    import importlib.resources as resources
    from the_alchemiser import config
    
    # Verify package exists
    assert config.__file__.endswith("__init__.py")
    
    # Verify files can be located
    pkg_files = resources.files("the_alchemiser.config")
    assert pkg_files.joinpath("strategy.dev.json").exists()
    assert pkg_files.joinpath("strategy.prod.json").exists()
```

### Recommendations
1. ✅ **No changes required** - File is correctly implemented
2. **Optional enhancement**: Add `__all__ = []` to explicitly document that no symbols are exported
3. **Optional enhancement**: Add a minimal smoke test as shown above
4. **Optional enhancement**: Add version comment in docstring if JSON schemas evolve

### Compliance Summary
- ✅ **Copilot Instructions**: Fully compliant
- ✅ **Module header**: Present and correct
- ✅ **Single Responsibility**: Perfect adherence
- ✅ **File size**: 5 lines (optimal)
- ✅ **Complexity**: Zero (optimal)
- ✅ **Security**: No concerns
- ✅ **Testing**: Adequately tested indirectly

## 6) Verdict

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED - No changes required**

This file is an exemplar of good design:
- Minimal code surface = minimal attack surface
- Single clear purpose with zero ambiguity
- Well-documented with operational context
- Follows Python best practices for resource packages
- No technical debt or complexity
- Adequately tested through integration tests

The file correctly implements its sole responsibility: marking a package directory for resource loading. Any additional code would be superfluous.
