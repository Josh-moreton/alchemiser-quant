**Business function / Module**: strategy_v2 / DSL Operators

**Runtime context**: DSL evaluation engine for strategy expressions. Pure computation, no I/O. Called during strategy evaluation within Lambda execution context.

**Criticality**: P1 (High) - Core comparison logic for trading strategy decision-making

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```
Internal:
- the_alchemiser.shared.schemas.ast_node (ASTNode)
- the_alchemiser.strategy_v2.engines.dsl.context (DslContext)
- the_alchemiser.strategy_v2.engines.dsl.dispatcher (DslDispatcher)
- the_alchemiser.strategy_v2.engines.dsl.types (DslEvaluationError, DSLValue)

External:
- decimal.Decimal (Python stdlib)
```

**External services touched**: None (pure computation)

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Consumed: ASTNode (from shared.schemas), DslContext
Produced: bool (comparison results), registered operators in DslDispatcher
Events: None (stateless operators)
```

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None identified.

### High
1. **Missing structured logging for comparison operations** (Lines 25-86)
   - Comparison operators perform business logic without emitting trace entries
   - No correlation_id tracking in log output for audit trail
   - Impact: Difficult to debug strategy decisions and trace evaluation paths

2. **Inconsistent numeric type handling in `equal` operator** (Lines 65-86)
   - Mixed-type comparisons (e.g., Decimal("42") vs string "42") return False silently
   - No validation or error for comparing incompatible types
   - Impact: Subtle bugs in DSL expressions with type mismatches

### Medium
3. **Missing docstring details for error conditions** (Lines 26, 36, 46, 56, 66)
   - Functions lack complete docstrings (no Args, Returns, Raises sections)
   - Pre/post-conditions not documented
   - Impact: Reduced maintainability and API clarity

4. **No explicit validation of DslContext state** (All functions)
   - Functions assume context.evaluate_node is callable and context properties exist
   - No defensive checks for None or invalid context
   - Impact: Potential AttributeError in edge cases

5. **Decimal equality check uses `==` operator** (Line 83)
   - Direct equality on Decimal is acceptable per Python semantics
   - However, project guidelines emphasize explicit tolerance for all numeric comparisons
   - Current implementation is technically correct but inconsistent with project philosophy

### Low
6. **Function parameter count validation is duplicated** (Lines 27-28, 37-38, 47-48, 57-58, 67-68)
   - Same validation pattern repeated 5 times
   - Could be extracted to a helper function or decorator
   - Impact: Minor code duplication (DRY violation)

7. **Magic number "2" appears 5 times** (Lines 27, 37, 47, 57, 67)
   - Could use a named constant `BINARY_OPERATOR_ARG_COUNT = 2`
   - Impact: Minor maintainability concern

### Info/Nits
8. **Module size**: 95 lines - well within 500-line soft limit ✓
9. **Cyclomatic complexity**: All functions are simple (estimated ≤ 3) ✓
10. **Test coverage**: Comprehensive unit and property-based tests exist ✓
11. **Type annotations**: Complete and precise ✓

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Solely implements comparison operators for DSL evaluation
  
- [ ] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ⚠️ Functions have single-line docstrings but lack Args/Returns/Raises sections
  
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ All parameters and return types are annotated correctly
  
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - ✅ Not applicable - operates on ASTNode which is validated upstream
  
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ✅ All numeric comparisons use Decimal via context.as_decimal()
  - ⚠️ Equal function uses `==` on Decimal (acceptable but could be more explicit)
  
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ✅ Uses DslEvaluationError from types module
  - ⚠️ No logging of errors or comparison results
  
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✅ Pure functions, no side effects (stateless operators)
  
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ Pure deterministic functions, comprehensive property tests exist
  
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No security concerns - pure computation
  
- [ ] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ❌ No logging present - missing audit trail for comparisons
  
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ✅ 32 tests including property-based tests with Hypothesis
  - ✅ Test coverage appears comprehensive
  
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ Pure computation, no I/O, minimal allocations
  
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ All functions are simple (estimated cyclomatic ≤ 3)
  - ✅ All functions < 20 lines
  - ✅ All functions have ≤ 2 parameters
  
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ 95 lines total - well within limits
  
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ Clean import structure, proper ordering

## 5) Additional Notes

### Strengths
1. **Excellent separation of concerns**: Pure comparison operators with no side effects
2. **Strong type safety**: Complete type annotations and leverages Decimal for numeric correctness
3. **Good test coverage**: Property-based tests validate mathematical properties (reflexivity, transitivity)
4. **Clean delegation pattern**: Uses DslContext for type coercion and node evaluation
5. **Simple, readable code**: No clever tricks, straightforward implementations
6. **Appropriate complexity**: Each function does exactly one thing

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Observability**: Add structured logging to trace comparison operations
   - Log comparison inputs and results with correlation_id
   - Use context.trace to add trace entries for audit
   - Follow pattern: one log line per comparison in structured JSON format
   
2. **Documentation**: Enhance docstrings with complete API documentation
   - Add Args, Returns, Raises sections
   - Document pre/post-conditions (e.g., "requires exactly 2 arguments")
   - Add usage examples in docstrings
   
3. **Error handling**: Improve handling of mixed-type comparisons
   - Consider warning when comparing incompatible types in `equal`
   - Document type coercion behavior in as_decimal
   
4. **Code quality**: Extract common validation logic
   - Create helper `_validate_binary_args(args: list[ASTNode]) -> None`
   - Define constant `BINARY_OPERATOR_ARG_COUNT = 2`
   
5. **Numeric precision**: Document Decimal equality semantics
   - Add comment explaining why `==` is safe for Decimal comparisons
   - Reference that Decimal equality is exact by design

### Recommendations

**Priority 1 (High):**
1. Add structured logging for all comparison operations
2. Document mixed-type comparison behavior in `equal` function

**Priority 2 (Medium):**
3. Enhance docstrings with complete Args/Returns/Raises sections
4. Add trace entries to context.trace for audit trail

**Priority 3 (Low):**
5. Extract common validation logic to reduce duplication
6. Add named constant for binary operator argument count

### Impact Assessment

**Current Risk Level**: Low-Medium
- File is correct and tested but lacks observability
- No blocking issues for production use
- Improvements would enhance auditability and maintainability

**Production Readiness**: ✅ Ready with minor caveats
- Core logic is sound and well-tested
- Missing observability is the main gap
- Recommended to add logging before next release

### Compliance Summary

**Copilot Instructions Compliance**:
- ✅ No float equality (`==`/`!=`) - uses Decimal
- ✅ Module header present and correct
- ✅ Strict typing enforced
- ⚠️ Missing correlation_id propagation in logs
- ✅ Idempotent (stateless pure functions)
- ✅ SRP maintained
- ✅ File size within limits (95 lines)
- ✅ Function size within limits (< 20 lines each)
- ✅ Complexity within limits (cyclomatic ≤ 3)
- ✅ Imports clean and ordered
- ✅ Property-based tests present

**Overall Grade**: A- (92/100)
- Deductions: Missing observability (-5), Incomplete docstrings (-3)
