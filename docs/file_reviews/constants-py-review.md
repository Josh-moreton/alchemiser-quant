## 0) Metadata

**File path**: `the_alchemiser/shared/constants.py`

**Commit SHA / Tag**: `802cf268358e3299fb6b80a4b7cf3d4bda2994f4` (reviewed) → `4932c8a` (fixed)

**Reviewer(s)**: GitHub Copilot

**Date**: 2025-10-10

**Business function / Module**: shared

**Runtime context**: Python module imported at startup by all business modules (strategy, portfolio, execution, orchestration). No I/O. Pure constants definition.

**Criticality**: P2 (Medium) - Used throughout system for validation, UI formatting, and business logic constants

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```
External: decimal.Decimal (stdlib)
Internal: None (this is a leaf module)
```

**External services touched**:
```
None - Pure constants module with no I/O or external service calls
```

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Produced: Exports constants used by:
  - shared.types.percentage (PERCENTAGE_RANGE)
  - shared.utils.validation_utils (MINIMUM_PRICE)
  - shared.events (EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION_DESCRIPTION, EVENT_TYPE_DESCRIPTION, etc.)
  - shared.notifications (APPLICATION_NAME)
  - execution_v2.handlers (DECIMAL_ZERO, EXECUTION_HANDLERS_MODULE)
  - strategy_v2.engines.dsl (DSL_ENGINE_MODULE)

Consumed: None
```

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- ✅ Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- ✅ Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- ✅ Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- ✅ Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- ✅ Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
**None identified**

### High
**None identified**

### Medium
1. ✅ **FIXED - Mutable validation constants** (lines 55-58): Sets (`SIGNAL_ACTIONS`, `ALERT_SEVERITIES`, `ORDER_TYPES`, `ORDER_SIDES`) were mutable; changed to `frozenset` for true immutability
2. ✅ **FIXED - Missing test coverage**: Created comprehensive test suite at `tests/shared/test_constants.py` with 49 unit and property-based tests

### Low
1. ✅ **FIXED - Missing type annotations**: Added explicit type hints (PEP 484) for all constants
2. ✅ **FIXED - Missing constant-level docstrings**: Added descriptive docstrings for all public constants using Python's triple-quote documentation format
3. ✅ **VERIFIED - Complete __all__ export**: All public constants properly exported in `__all__`

### Info/Nits
1. ✅ **IMPROVED - Module docstring**: Enhanced with information about immutability guarantees and Decimal usage
2. ✅ **IMPROVED - Grouping clarity**: Maintained clear comment-based grouping of related constants

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Purpose: Centralized constants repository
  - ✅ Single responsibility: Only constant definitions, no logic
  - ✅ No mixed concerns

- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ✅ Module-level docstring enhanced
  - ✅ Constant-level docstrings added for all public constants
  - N/A No functions or classes in this module

- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ All constants now have explicit type annotations
  - ✅ Used appropriate types: `str`, `Decimal`, `tuple[Decimal, Decimal]`, `frozenset[str]`
  - ✅ No `Any` types present

- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - N/A No DTOs in this module
  - ✅ All collections are now immutable (tuples, frozensets)
  - ✅ Decimal values are immutable by design

- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ✅ All financial values use `Decimal`: `DECIMAL_ZERO`, `MIN_TRADE_AMOUNT_USD`, `MINIMUM_PRICE`
  - ✅ Range bounds use `Decimal`: `CONFIDENCE_RANGE`, `PERCENTAGE_RANGE`
  - ✅ No float comparisons in module

- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - N/A No error handling needed - pure constants module
  - ✅ Invalid imports would fail at module load time with clear ImportError

- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - N/A No side effects - pure constants
  - ✅ Module imports are idempotent

- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ All constants are deterministic
  - ✅ No randomness or time-based logic
  - ✅ Tests verify constant values explicitly

- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No secrets present
  - ✅ No dynamic code execution
  - ✅ AWS region is non-sensitive configuration constant

- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - N/A No logging in constants module
  - ✅ Module identifiers exported for use in logging by other modules

- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ✅ Created comprehensive test suite: `tests/shared/test_constants.py`
  - ✅ 49 tests covering all constants
  - ✅ Includes property-based tests with Hypothesis
  - ✅ Tests verify: types, values, immutability, membership, exports

- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - N/A No I/O or computation
  - ✅ Module loads once at startup
  - ✅ All constant access is O(1)

- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ No functions or control flow
  - ✅ Complexity = 0 (only constant assignments)

- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ 152 lines (well under limit)
  - ✅ Appropriate size for constants module

- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ Clean imports: only `from __future__` and `from decimal`
  - ✅ Correct import order
  - ✅ No wildcard imports

## 5) Additional Notes

### Changes Implemented

1. **Enhanced Module Docstring**
   - Added information about Decimal usage for financial precision
   - Documented immutability guarantees for validation constants
   - Added type annotation policy note

2. **Added Type Annotations**
   - All 31 constants now have explicit type annotations
   - Types include: `str`, `Decimal`, `tuple[Decimal, Decimal]`, `frozenset[str]`
   - Improves IDE support and static type checking

3. **Added Constant-Level Docstrings**
   - Every constant has a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose
   - Financial constants explain units (e.g., "1 cent", "USD")
   - Validation constants explain ranges and immutability

4. **Fixed Immutability Issues**
   - Changed `set` to `frozenset` for:
     - `SIGNAL_ACTIONS`: `{"BUY", "SELL", "HOLD"}` → `frozenset({"BUY", "SELL", "HOLD"})`
     - `ALERT_SEVERITIES`: `{"INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR"}` → `frozenset(...)`
     - `ORDER_TYPES`: `{"market", "limit"}` → `frozenset(...)`
     - `ORDER_SIDES`: `{"buy", "sell"}` → `frozenset(...)`
   - Prevents accidental runtime modification
   - Maintains O(1) membership testing performance

5. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - File: `tests/shared/test_constants.py`
   - 49 tests organized into 10 test classes
   - Coverage includes:
     - Type verification for all constants
     - Value correctness tests
     - Immutability tests
     - Range validation tests
     - `__all__` export completeness
     - Property-based tests with Hypothesis

### Architecture Observations

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clear single responsibility as constants repository
- ✅ Leaf module with minimal dependencies
- ✅ Proper use of `Decimal` for financial values
- ✅ Well-organized with comment-based grouping
- ✅ Complete `__all__` export list

**Potential Future Improvements (Not Blocking):**
- Consider using `typing.Final` (PEP 591) to mark constants as truly final
- Could extract validation enums to separate typed module if they grow
- Consider creating a `shared.constants.validation` submodule if validation constants expand significantly

### Security & Compliance

**✅ No security issues identified**
- No secrets or credentials
- No dynamic code execution
- No untrusted input processing
- AWS region is appropriate configuration constant

### Performance Characteristics

**✅ Optimal performance**
- Module loads once at Python startup
- All constant access is O(1)
- No runtime overhead
- `frozenset` membership tests are O(1) average case

### Test Results

```bash
# All tests passing
pytest tests/shared/test_constants.py -v
# 49 passed in 1.01s

# Type checking passes
mypy the_alchemiser/shared/constants.py --config-file=pyproject.toml
# Success: no issues found in 1 source file

# Linting passes
ruff check the_alchemiser/shared/constants.py
# All checks passed!

# Integration with existing code verified
pytest tests/shared/types/test_percentage.py -v
# 32 passed in 1.63s (percentage module uses PERCENTAGE_RANGE)
```
