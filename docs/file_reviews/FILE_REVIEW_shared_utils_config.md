**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```
Internal: None
External: typing.Any (standard library)
```

**External services touched**:
```
None - Placeholder implementation
```

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Produces: ModularConfig instances (placeholder)

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None - File is a placeholder implementation

### High
None - No active usage in production code

### Medium
1. **Missing module header** - File lacks required business unit header per coding standards
2. **Missing from __init__.py exports** - Public API not exposed in parent module
3. **Loose typing with `object`** - Using `object` instead of `Any` or specific types
4. **No tests** - Placeholder functionality has zero test coverage

### Low
1. **Phase 2 placeholder** - File documented as temporary, creating technical debt
2. **No logging** - Future implementation should include structured logging
3. **No error handling** - get/set operations lack validation or error cases
4. **Mutable internal state** - _config dict is mutable, violating immutability principles

### Info/Nits
1. **Docstrings are good** - All public APIs properly documented
2. **Type hints present** - Basic type hints are provided
3. **Import organization** - Follows standard library → third-party → local order

## 3) Line-by-Line Notes

### Detailed Line-by-Line Analysis

| Line(s) | Issue / Observation | Severity | Evidence / Excerpt | Proposed Action |
|---------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1-5 | Missing module header | Medium | Module lacks required `"""Business Unit: shared \| Status: current."""` header | Add proper module header before docstring |
| 1-5 | Placeholder notice clear | Info | Clearly documents placeholder status: "Currently under construction - no logic implemented yet." | Keep as-is, good communication |
| 9 | Use of `Any` type | Low | `from typing import Any` - imported but used for dict values | Acceptable for placeholder, review in Phase 2 |
| 12-44 | Mutable state in ModularConfig | Low | `self._config: dict[str, Any] = {}` - mutable dict allows modification | Consider frozen/immutable pattern in Phase 2 |
| 23 | Return type uses `object` | Medium | `def get(...) -> object:` - too generic | Should be `Any` or properly typed |
| 23 | Default parameter type | Medium | `default: object = None` - inconsistent with return type | Should match return type or use `Any` |
| 36 | Setter parameter type | Medium | `value: object` - too generic | Should be `Any` or properly typed |
| 47-57 | Placeholder implementation | Info | Returns empty ModularConfig, no actual loading | Expected for Phase 1, document timeline for Phase 2 |
| 60-69 | Placeholder implementation | Info | Returns empty ModularConfig, no actual loading | Expected for Phase 1, document timeline for Phase 2 |
| All | No error handling | Low | No validation, no error cases, no logging | Add in Phase 2 when implementing actual logic |
| All | No tests | Medium | Zero test coverage for this module | Add basic placeholder tests |
| All | Not exported in __init__ | Medium | Module not exposed in `shared/utils/__init__.py` | Add exports if intended to be public |

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - Single purpose: placeholder configuration management
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - All public APIs have proper docstrings
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - Basic type hints present, `object` usage should be replaced with `Any`
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - Not applicable - no DTOs defined
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - Not applicable - no numerical operations
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - Not applicable for placeholder - no error conditions yet
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - Not applicable - no side effects in placeholder
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - Not applicable - no non-deterministic behavior
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - Clean - no security concerns
- [ ] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - Missing - should add logging when implementing Phase 2
- [ ] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - **FAIL** - No tests exist for this module
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - Not applicable - no I/O or performance-sensitive operations
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - All functions are simple (< 10 lines each)
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - Only 70 lines - well within limits
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - Clean import structure

## 5) Additional Notes

### Current Status
This file is a **Phase 1 placeholder** for future configuration management functionality. It provides minimal scaffolding to support the modular architecture migration but contains no actual business logic.

### Usage Analysis
- **No active usage found** in the codebase (grep confirmed no imports)
- Not exported in `shared/utils/__init__.py` 
- Appears to be scaffolding for future event-driven configuration

### Comparison with Actual Config Module
The repository already has a robust, production-ready configuration system in `the_alchemiser/shared/config/config.py` that:
- Uses Pydantic BaseSettings for environment variable loading
- Provides typed configuration sections (Alpaca, AWS, Alerts, Strategy, etc.)
- Has proper validation and defaults
- Includes dependency injection via `container.py`

This `shared/utils/config.py` appears to be for a **different purpose** - likely for runtime module-level configuration as opposed to application-level settings.

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (Required for compliance)
1. **Add module header**: `"""Business Unit: shared | Status: current."""`
2. **Fix type annotations**: Replace `object` with `Any` or proper types
3. **Add basic tests**: Even placeholder code should have tests
4. **Document relationship**: Clarify how this differs from `shared/config/config.py`

#### Short-term (Before Phase 2)
5. **Export decision**: Either export in `__init__.py` or mark as internal with `_` prefix
6. **Add TODO/FIXME**: Document specific Phase 2 implementation requirements
7. **Consider immutability**: Plan for frozen configuration in Phase 2

#### Long-term (Phase 2 implementation)
8. **Implement actual loading**: Config file reading, validation, merging
9. **Add observability**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
10. **Add error handling**: Typed exceptions from `shared.errors`
11. **Consider Pydantic**: Use Pydantic models for type safety and validation
12. **Thread safety**: If used in concurrent contexts, add locking

### Related Issues
None found - this is the first comprehensive review of this file.

### Risk Assessment
**Current risk: LOW** - File is unused placeholder with no production impact.
**Phase 2 risk: MEDIUM** - Will become critical if used for runtime configuration without proper validation, error handling, and observability.
