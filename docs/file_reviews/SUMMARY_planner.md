## Key Findings by Severity

### All High Priority Issues Resolved ✅

1. ✅ **Line 157: Exception Handling** - Fixed
   - Changed from broad `Exception` catch to specific exceptions
   - Added error_type and exc_info for better debugging
   ```python
   except (ValueError, KeyError, TypeError, AttributeError, PortfolioError) as e:
       logger.error(
           "Failed to build rebalance plan",
           module=MODULE_NAME,
           error_type=type(e).__name__,
           exc_info=True,
       )
   ```

2. ✅ **Lines 202-204: Float/Decimal Precision** - Fixed
   - Changed from float arithmetic to pure Decimal
   ```python
   # Before
   usage_multiplier = Decimal(str(1.0 - settings.alpaca.cash_reserve_pct))
   
   # After
   usage_multiplier = Decimal("1") - Decimal(str(settings.alpaca.cash_reserve_pct))
   ```

3. ℹ️ **Idempotency Protection** - Deferred (orchestrator responsibility)

### Medium Priority Issues Resolved ✅

4. ✅ **Lines 87, 337: Structured Logging** - Fixed
   ```python
   # Before
   logger.info(f"Applying minimum trade threshold ${min_trade_threshold}...")
   
   # After
   logger.info(
       "Applying minimum trade threshold",
       module=MODULE_NAME,
       threshold=str(min_trade_threshold),
       percentage="1%",
   )
   ```

5. ℹ️ **Non-deterministic plan_id** - Acceptable for production traceability

### Low Priority Items Resolved ✅

6. ✅ **Line 27: Logger type hint** - Added `Logger` type
7. ✅ **Line 40: Empty `__init__`** - Removed
8. ✅ **Lines 367-375: Priority constants** - Extracted to module constants

## Recommendations

### ✅ All High and Medium Priority Items Completed

All actionable findings from the file review have been addressed:

1. ✅ Exception handling narrowed to specific types
2. ✅ Float/Decimal precision fixed
3. ✅ Structured logging implemented throughout
4. ✅ Logger type hint added
5. ✅ Empty `__init__` removed
6. ✅ Priority constants extracted

### Remaining Enhancements (Optional)

These items are non-critical and can be addressed in future iterations:

1. **Configuration Enhancement** (Low priority)
   - Make tolerance and urgency configurable via settings
   - Currently uses reasonable hard-coded defaults

2. **Documentation Enhancement** (Low priority)
   - Add examples to class docstring
   - Add detailed docstrings to private methods

3. **Property-based Testing** (Enhancement)
   - Add Hypothesis tests for allocation invariants
   - Test weight conservation: sum(target_weights) ≈ 1.0
   - Test trade value conservation

4. **Idempotency Support** (Architecture)
   - Consider deterministic plan_id generation for testing
   - Handle at orchestrator level for production
   - Not blocking for current implementation

## Architecture Notes

### Design Patterns

1. **Stateless Calculator**: Each call to `build_plan` is independent with no shared state
2. **Clear Delegation**: Helper methods for each calculation phase
3. **Immutable DTOs**: All inputs/outputs are frozen Pydantic models
4. **Defensive Programming**: Edge case handling throughout

### Key Features

1. **Cash Reserve Management** (lines 202-204)
   - Prevents buying power violations
   - 1% default reserve (configurable via settings)
   - Critical for Alpaca API compliance

2. **Micro-trade Suppression** (lines 85-89, 325-355)
   - Filters trades below 1% of portfolio
   - Prevents excessive small adjustments
   - Valuable for high-frequency rebalancing

3. **SELL-before-BUY Ordering** (lines 306-313)
   - Ensures SELL orders execute first
   - Frees buying power for BUY orders
   - Critical for successful execution

4. **Priority System** (lines 357-375)
   - Assigns priority based on trade size
   - Larger trades get higher priority
   - Simple but effective

### Integration Points

**Consumes**:
- `StrategyAllocation` from strategy_v2
- `PortfolioSnapshot` from portfolio state reader
- Config via `load_settings()`

**Produces**:
- `RebalancePlan` for execution_v2
- Structured logs with correlation tracking
