**File path**: `the_alchemiser/shared/utils/strategy_utils.py`

**Commit SHA / Tag**: `802cf268358e3299fb6b80a4b7cf3d4bda2994f4` (file created after this commit)

**Reviewer(s)**: GitHub Copilot (Automated Review)

**Date**: 2025-10-05

**Business function / Module**: shared / utilities

**Runtime context**: Synchronous utility function, called during strategy orchestration initialization

**Criticality**: **P2 (Medium)** - Core configuration utility but currently simple/hardcoded

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```
Internal: the_alchemiser.shared.types.strategy_types.StrategyType
External: (none - pure Python)
```

**External services touched**: None (pure function)

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Produced: dict[StrategyType, float] (allocation mapping)
Consumed: None
```

**Related docs/specs**:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Coding standards)
- `the_alchemiser/shared/types/strategy_registry.py` (Similar functionality)
- `the_alchemiser/shared/config/config.py` (Configuration management)

## 1) Scope & Objectives

✅ **Completed Review Items:**
- ✅ Verified file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability
- ✅ Ensured **correctness** and **deterministic behaviour**
- ✅ Validated **type safety**, **observability**, and **compliance** controls
- ✅ Confirmed **interfaces/contracts** are accurate and tested
- ✅ Identified **complexity hotspots** and **performance characteristics**
- ✅ Assessed **testing coverage** (10 comprehensive tests created)

## 2) Summary of Findings

### ✅ Critical
**NONE** - No critical issues found

### ⚠️ High
**NONE** - No high severity issues found

### 📋 Medium
1. **Potential duplication with `StrategyRegistry.get_default_allocations()`** - Similar functionality exists in `shared/types/strategy_registry.py`
2. **Hardcoded allocation** - Function returns hardcoded value instead of reading from configuration
3. **Lack of observability** - No logging or correlation ID support for traceability

### 📌 Low
1. **No input validation** - Function takes no parameters, but future versions might need config injection
2. **Missing error handling** - No try/except for future configuration reads (acceptable for current implementation)
3. **Docstring could specify float precision** - Doesn't mention that allocations should sum to exactly 1.0

### ℹ️ Info/Nits
1. **Comment clarity** - Line 30 comment could be more specific about migration timeline
2. **Function name** - Could be more specific (e.g., `get_default_strategy_allocations`)
3. **Missing version tracking** - No schema_version or versioning for future compatibility

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Single function, single responsibility: provide strategy allocations
  
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ✅ Comprehensive docstring with Returns section and Example
  
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ Return type fully annotated: `dict[StrategyType, float]`
  - ✅ No function parameters (no `Any` risk)
  
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - ✅ Returns plain dict (appropriate for this use case)
  - ✅ StrategyType is an Enum (inherently immutable)
  
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ✅ Returns float allocations (percentages, not currency)
  - ✅ Test suite uses `math.isclose()` for validation
  - ⚠️ Function itself doesn't validate sum (acceptable - validation in tests)
  
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ✅ No error handling needed (pure function, no I/O, no external dependencies)
  - ✅ Cannot fail in current implementation
  
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✅ Pure function, fully idempotent
  - ✅ Verified by test: `test_idempotency()`
  
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ Fully deterministic (returns constant)
  - ✅ No time/random dependencies
  
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No secrets, no dynamic code execution
  - ✅ No external input (zero-parameter function)
  
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ⚠️ No logging (acceptable for pure utility function)
  - 📋 Consider adding debug-level log if called frequently in orchestration
  
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ✅ **100% line coverage** achieved
  - ✅ 10 comprehensive unit tests created
  - ✅ Tests cover: type safety, numerical correctness, idempotency, contracts
  
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ O(1) constant time, zero allocations beyond return dict
  - ✅ No I/O, no network calls, no blocking operations
  
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ Cyclomatic complexity: **1** (trivial)
  - ✅ Cognitive complexity: **1** (trivial)
  - ✅ Function length: **4 lines** (excluding docstring)
  - ✅ Parameters: **0**
  
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ **33 lines total** - excellent
  
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ Single clean import: `from the_alchemiser.shared.types.strategy_types import StrategyType`
  - ✅ No wildcard imports

## 5) Additional Notes

### Architecture & Design Observations

1. **Excellent Simplicity**: This is a model of clean, simple utility code. It does exactly one thing and does it well.

2. **Potential Redundancy**: The function has similar behavior to `StrategyRegistry.get_default_allocations()` in `the_alchemiser/shared/types/strategy_registry.py`. Both return `{StrategyType.DSL: 1.0}`. Consider:
   - **Option A**: Remove one and consolidate (prefer `StrategyRegistry` as it's more domain-aligned)
   - **Option B**: Differentiate purposes (e.g., one for defaults, one for runtime overrides)
   - **Option C**: Document why both exist (different contexts/phases)

3. **Migration Path**: Function is explicitly temporary ("For this DSL-focused PR"). Consider:
   - Adding a TODO comment with ticket reference for future enhancement
   - Adding deprecation notice in docstring when multiple strategies are enabled
   - Planning for config-driven allocation in future versions

4. **Testing Excellence**: Created comprehensive test suite with 10 tests covering:
   - Type correctness
   - Numerical integrity (sum to 1.0 with proper float comparison)
   - Idempotency and determinism
   - Contract validation
   - Docstring example verification

### Compliance Assessment

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Copilot Instructions | ✅ Pass | All rules followed |
| SRP | ✅ Pass | Single clear purpose |
| Type Safety | ✅ Pass | Full type hints, mypy clean |
| Testing | ✅ Pass | 100% coverage, 10 tests |
| Complexity | ✅ Pass | Trivial complexity (1) |
| Documentation | ✅ Pass | Comprehensive docstring |
| Security | ✅ Pass | No security risks |
| Float Handling | ✅ Pass | Tests use math.isclose |

### Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - constant time
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - single dict with one entry
- **Memory Allocation**: ~200 bytes (dict + enum reference)
- **Execution Time**: < 1 microsecond
- **Suitable for**: Hot path execution (zero overhead)

### Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Add comprehensive test coverage
   - Created `tests/shared/utils/test_strategy_utils.py` with 10 tests
   - Achieves 100% line coverage
   - All tests passing

2. 📋 **Optional**: Clarify relationship with `StrategyRegistry.get_default_allocations()`
   - Document why both functions exist
   - Consider consolidation in future refactor (low priority)

3. 📌 **Optional**: Add structured logging (debug level)
   - Only if function is called in hot path during orchestration
   - Include allocation summary in log
   - Low priority (pure utility function)

4. ℹ️ **Optional**: Enhance docstring
   - Add "Note" section explaining temporary/migration nature
   - Add reference to future config-driven behavior
   - Very low priority (current docstring is good)

### Future Evolution Considerations

When this function evolves beyond DSL-only phase:

```python
def get_strategy_allocations(
    config: StrategySettings | None = None,
) -> dict[StrategyType, float]:
    """Get strategy allocations from config or safe defaults.
    
    Args:
        config: Optional strategy configuration override
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping StrategyType to allocation percentages
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If allocations don't sum to ~1.0
        
    Example:
        >>> # Use defaults
        >>> allocations = get_strategy_allocations()
        >>> 
        >>> # Use custom config
        >>> from the_alchemiser.shared.config.config import Settings
        >>> settings = Settings()
        >>> allocations = get_strategy_allocations(settings.strategy)
    """
    if config is None:
        # Safe defaults (current behavior)
        return {StrategyType.DSL: 1.0}
    
    # Extract from config when multi-strategy support added
    allocations = config.default_strategy_allocations
    
    # Validate sum
    total = sum(allocations.values())
    if not math.isclose(total, 1.0, abs_tol=1e-9):
        raise ValueError(f"Strategy allocations must sum to 1.0, got {total}")
    
    return allocations
```
