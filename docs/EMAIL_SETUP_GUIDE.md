- **Market Context**: SPY price, RSI levels, market regime analysis
- **Error Notifications**: If the bot encounters issues

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Email Configuration

The bot is configured to use **Apple iCloud SMTP** with these settings:
- **SMTP Server**: `smtp.mail.me.com`
- **Port**: `587`
- **From Email**: `joshuamoreton1@icloud.com`
- **To Email**: `josh@rwxt.org`

### 2. Environment Variables

You need to set the `SMTP_PASSWORD` environment variable with your iCloud app password:

```bash
# For local testing
export SMTP_PASSWORD="your-icloud-app-password"

# For GitHub Actions (already configured in secrets)
# SMTP_PASSWORD is set as a repository secret
```

### 3. iCloud App Password Setup

1. Go to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)
2. Sign in and go to "Security" section
3. Generate an App-Specific Password for "Nuclear Trading Bot"
4. Use this password as your `SMTP_PASSWORD`

## Running the Email Bot

### Option 1: Main Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the full email-enabled nuclear trading bot
python main.py email
```

### Option 2: Direct Email Bot
```bash
# Alternative direct launcher
python run_email_bot.py
```

### Option 3: Test Email Only
```bash
# Test just the email functionality
cd src/core && python nuclear_signal_email.py
```
