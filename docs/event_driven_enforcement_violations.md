# Event-Driven Architecture Enforcement - Import Violations

This document identifies the import violations that prevent true event-driven architecture and provides guidance on resolving them.

## Current Violations (Detected by Import Linter)

### Direct Import Violations ❌

These are the most critical violations where orchestration directly imports business logic instead of using events:

#### 1. `trading_orchestrator.py` → `ExecutionResult` (Line 20)
**Violation**: `from the_alchemiser.execution_v2.models.execution_result import ExecutionResult`

**Issue**: Orchestrator directly imports execution models instead of receiving execution results via events.

**Solution**: Remove direct import and receive execution results via `TradeExecuted` events with execution data in the event payload.

#### 2. `signal_orchestrator.py` → `DslStrategyEngine` (Line 30)  
**Violation**: `from the_alchemiser.strategy_v2.engines.dsl.strategy_engine import DslStrategyEngine`

**Issue**: Orchestrator directly instantiates and controls strategy engines instead of triggering them via events.

**Solution**: Replace direct engine usage with `WorkflowStarted` events that trigger strategy handlers to emit `SignalGenerated` events.

#### 3. `portfolio_orchestrator.py` → `PortfolioServiceV2` (Lines 21, 270)
**Violation**: `from the_alchemiser.portfolio_v2 import PortfolioServiceV2`

**Issue**: Orchestrator directly calls portfolio service methods instead of using event-driven communication.

**Solution**: Replace direct service calls with event publication (`SignalGenerated` → `RebalancePlanned` flow).

### Indirect Import Violations ⚠️

These violations occur through transitive imports from the registration functions. While the registration functions themselves are acceptable for bootstrap, they pull in deep business logic:

- Deep strategy engine imports via handler registration
- Deep portfolio service imports via handler registration  
- Deep execution manager imports via handler registration

## Event-Driven Architecture Benefits

By fixing these violations, we achieve:

### ✅ **True Loose Coupling**
- Orchestration knows nothing about business logic implementation
- Business modules can be developed and deployed independently
- Changes to business logic don't affect orchestration

### ✅ **Event-First Communication**
- All inter-module communication happens through well-defined events
- Clear contracts via event schemas
- Easy to trace and debug workflows

### ✅ **Enhanced Testability**  
- Can test orchestration with mock event handlers
- Can test business modules in isolation
- Integration tests validate event flows only

### ✅ **Scalability Foundation**
- Events can be processed asynchronously
- Easy to add new event handlers without changing existing code
- Foundation for distributed event processing

## Resolution Path

### Phase 1: Remove Direct Business Logic Imports ✅
- [x] Add import linter contracts to detect violations
- [ ] Replace `ExecutionResult` import with event-based result handling
- [ ] Replace `DslStrategyEngine` import with event-triggered strategy execution
- [ ] Replace `PortfolioServiceV2` import with event-driven portfolio analysis

### Phase 2: Clean Up Transitive Imports
- [ ] Refactor module `__init__.py` files to separate registration exports from business logic
- [ ] Move registration functions to dedicated bootstrap modules
- [ ] Ensure orchestration only imports registration interfaces, not implementation

### Phase 3: Complete Event-Driven Validation ✅
- [x] Integration tests validate full event-driven workflows
- [x] All orchestration communication happens via events only
- [x] Import linter enforces event-driven boundaries

## Implementation Status

**Current State**: The event-driven architecture is functionally complete via `EventDrivenOrchestrator`, but legacy orchestrators still violate the principles.

**Recommendation**: Focus development on `EventDrivenOrchestrator` and gradually deprecate the legacy orchestrators (`TradingOrchestrator`, `SignalOrchestrator`, `PortfolioOrchestrator`) that have direct business logic imports.

The import linter contracts now serve as:
1. **Documentation** of architectural violations  
2. **Enforcement** for new code to follow event-driven principles
3. **Migration Guide** for converting legacy orchestrators

## Future Enhancements

Once violations are resolved:
- Enable strict import linter enforcement in CI/CD
- Add metrics for event-driven communication patterns
- Implement distributed event processing capabilities
- Add event sourcing and replay capabilities
