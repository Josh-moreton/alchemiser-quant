# Comparison of **TECL\_for\_the\_long\_term** vs **Nuclear** Trading Strategies

## Strategy Overview

**TECL\_for\_the\_long\_term (v7):** A Clojure-based symphony strategy that primarily trades technology sector leverage (via **TECL**, a 3× tech ETF). It uses a regime filter and **RSI-based triggers** to toggle between aggressive tech exposure and safe assets (like T-bills or bonds). The strategy incorporates a **200-day moving average** of SPY as a trend filter and multiple RSI thresholds on tech indices to decide when to go long, go to cash, or hedge with volatility instruments. It often allocates either to **TECL** (risk-on tech exposure) or to safe assets (e.g. **BIL** – a T-bill ETF) and hedges (like **UVXY** – a VIX futures ETF) based on market conditions.

**Nuclear (Feaver Frontrunner V5):** A more complex symphony strategy that combines **thematic stock selection (nuclear energy equities)** with dynamic hedging. It similarly uses a **trend filter** (SPY’s 200-day moving average) to switch between a “Bull” portfolio of nuclear energy stocks and a “Bear” defensive strategy. The Nuclear strategy employs a multi-layered set of **RSI triggers** across various market indices (SPY, global equities, tech, value, financials, etc.) to determine entries/exits. It hedges aggressively with **UVXY** (often paired with **BTAL**, an anti-beta fund) during overbought conditions, and toggles between leveraged longs (like **TQQQ** or **UPRO**) and short positions (**SQQQ** or **PSQ**) in downturns based on oversold signals and momentum conditions.

## Entry and Exit Triggers

Both strategies rely on **indicator thresholds and logical conditions** to initiate or exit positions, but they differ in focus:

* **Trend Regime Filter:** **TECL strategy** uses the SPY 200-day moving average as a binary regime test. If SPY’s price is above its 200-day MA (uptrend), the strategy operates in a bullish mode; if below, it shifts to a bearish mode. **Nuclear strategy** similarly checks if SPY is trading above its 200-day MA to choose between a bullish “Nuclear Energy Portfolio” and a bearish protective stance. This means *both* strategies step back from risk when the broad market trend is negative, but otherwise allow risk-on trades during uptrends.

* **Overbought Conditions (Exit or Hedge Triggers):** Both systems define **RSI thresholds** to signal that markets are overheating and to **trigger hedges or exits**. The TECL strategy monitors RSI(10) on tech-heavy indices: e.g., if 10-day RSI on TQQQ (3× NASDAQ 100) exceeds \~79, it rotates out of tech into a protective mix of **volatility and cash** (25% UVXY and 75% BIL). Likewise, if SPY’s RSI > 80 in an uptrend, TECL moves to the same UVXY+cash defensive position. The Nuclear strategy has a cascading sequence of RSI triggers on multiple indices. For instance, if SPY’s 10-day RSI > 79, it initiates a hedge routine: if RSI > 81 (extremely overbought), it goes **100% UVXY**; if moderately overbought (just above 79), it checks other sectors (global equities IOO, tech TQQQ, value VTV, financials XLF, communications VOX) in turn. If any of those indices have RSI > 81, Nuclear also goes full **UVXY**; if none are above the extreme threshold but the warning level (79) is breached, it allocates to a **75% UVXY / 25% BTAL** hedge basket. This tiered logic means Nuclear might hedge at the first sign of overheating in any major market segment, whereas TECL’s hedging is triggered specifically by tech or broad-market RSI extremes. In summary, both strategies use **RSI-overbought triggers** to exit long positions and enter hedges, but TECL’s triggers revolve around tech index RSI levels, while Nuclear scans a broader set of indices for confirmation.

* **Oversold Conditions (Entry or Flip Triggers):** Both strategies also attempt to **catch bottoms or relief rallies** using **oversold RSI thresholds**. In the TECL strategy (especially when in bear mode), if the 10-day RSI on TQQQ falls below \~30 (signaling NASDAQ is deeply oversold), it *enters* a long tech position – specifically allocating to **TECL** to ride a potential rebound. Similarly, if the S\&P 500’s 3× ETF (SPXL) RSI < 29, TECL will allocate to **SPXL** to catch a broad-market rebound. The Nuclear strategy uses comparable contrarian signals: if TQQQ’s RSI < 30, it buys **TQQQ** (3× NASDAQ long); if SPY’s RSI < 30, it buys **UPRO** (3× S\&P long). These are aggressive entries aimed at bottoms. Both strategies, therefore, will **flip to leveraged longs when conditions are deeply oversold**, expecting a mean-reversion rally. The difference is that TECL’s oversold triggers are mainly active during identified bear regimes (after SPY < 200MA) and focus on tech/S\&P indices, whereas Nuclear’s oversold triggers are part of its general logic and also focus on tech (TQQQ) and broad market (SPY) indices. In practice, both would enter trades around similar RSI levels, using 3× ETFs to capitalize on bounces.

* **Other Entry/Exit Logic:** Beyond RSI extremes, TECL\_for\_the\_long\_term includes a unique **relative strength comparison** between the tech sector and a managed futures index (KMLM). Within the bullish regime, if neither TQQQ nor SPY RSI are at extreme highs, TECL’s logic compares 10-day RSI of XLK (Tech sector ETF) vs. RSI of KMLM (managed futures). If tech momentum is stronger (XLK RSI > KMLM RSI), the strategy stays in **TECL** unless tech gets overbought (RSI > 81 triggers a shift to cash). If instead *managed futures* are relatively stronger (tech lagging), TECL strategy avoids equities – it stays in cash (BIL) unless tech becomes extremely oversold (XLK RSI < 29, in which case it buys TECL for a contrarian play). This logic effectively times entry into tech based on whether the tech sector’s momentum outpaces an alternative strategy (managed futures) and uses RSI bands (81/29) on XLK to decide between **full risk-on (TECL)** or **risk-off (BIL)**. The Nuclear strategy doesn’t use managed futures or that specific relative comparison; instead, it employs **short-term trend and momentum checks** in bear markets (e.g., whether TQQQ is above its 20-day moving average, or comparing RSI of safe-haven bonds vs. short ETF RSI) to decide flipping long or staying short. For example, in a protracted downtrend, Nuclear checks if QQQ’s 60-day return is worse than –10% to identify a deep bear scenario, and uses bond momentum (RSI of TLT or IEF vs RSI of PSQ) as a signal for potential trend reversal. These conditions trigger exits from short positions or entries into longs. In short, TECL’s entries/exits are primarily driven by RSI thresholds and a tech-vs-alternative momentum signal, whereas Nuclear’s are driven by a **broader set of signals** (RSI across indices, trend filters on QQQ, bond vs equity momentum) that cause it to enter or exit various long/short positions.

## Asset Exposure and Allocation

Despite some overlap in instruments, the two strategies allocate capital differently and have distinct asset focuses:

* **Primary Long Positions:** In risk-on scenarios, **TECL\_for\_the\_long\_term** concentrates its exposure in **TECL**, the 3× leveraged Technology sector ETF. This is the core bullish asset for the strategy whenever conditions allow (tech momentum favorable and not overbought). Occasionally, it will use **SPXL** (3× S\&P 500 ETF) on sharp broad-market dips, but tech leverage is its hallmark. In contrast, the **Nuclear strategy** allocates to a **basket of nuclear energy-related equities** during its bull phase. It doesn’t hold TECL or TQQQ in normal uptrends; instead, it constructs a “Nuclear Energy Portfolio” – selecting the top 3 performers from a list of nuclear industry stocks/ETFs (e.g. SMR, BWXT, LEU, EXC, NLR, OKLO) based on 90-day momentum, weighted by inverse volatility. This means Nuclear’s primary equity exposure is a *sector-specific stock portfolio*, which can behave very differently from the broad tech sector. Both strategies thus have concentrated bets: TECL strategy on leveraged tech, and Nuclear on a niche energy sector – each aiming for high growth but in distinct domains.

* **Use of Leverage and Short Instruments:** Both strategies make use of **leveraged ETFs** for tactical moves. TECL strategy uses **leveraged longs** (TECL, SPXL) for bullish bets and will occasionally employ **SQQQ** (3× short NASDAQ) as a bearish position in certain downtrend conditions. Specifically, if the strategy is in a bear regime and tech momentum is weak without being oversold, it picks between **SQQQ** or a bond ETF (BSV) based on short-term RSI to either short the market or stay in bonds. The Nuclear strategy also uses **TQQQ** and **UPRO** as leveraged longs during oversold bounces, and relies heavily on **SQQQ** (3× short QQQ) or **PSQ** (1× short QQQ) for bearish exposure. In its bear-mode logic, Nuclear will default to short positions (often SQQQ) unless specific conditions prompt a long entry or a lighter short (PSQ). It even splits its bear strategy into two sub-approaches (“Bear 1” and “Bear 2”) combined by volatility-based weighting, ensuring some allocation to short QQQ in most down scenarios. **Both strategies therefore trade SQQQ in drawdowns**, but TECL’s use of short exposure is more conditional and sometimes replaced with cash or bonds, whereas Nuclear maintains short positions more systematically (using PSQ/SQQQ) during bearish periods.

* **Safe Assets and Cash Allocation:** A key difference is how each strategy allocates to *truly safe* assets. **TECL\_for\_the\_long\_term** frequently moves to **cash equivalents** (like **BIL**, a 1–3 month T-bill ETF) when signals turn risk-off. For example, if tech is overbought or underperforming relative to KMLM, the strategy parks in BIL (effectively a cash position). It also uses **BSV** (short-term bond ETF) as an alternative safe asset in certain bear conditions (when not shorting, it may select BSV). This means TECL’s exposure can drop to very low-risk assets, avoiding market volatility altogether at times. The **Nuclear strategy**, on the other hand, rarely goes to pure cash or Treasury bills. Instead, its notion of “safe” allocation is more **relative or hedged exposure**: when not in equities, it may hold **BTAL** (an anti-beta market-neutral fund) as part of a hedge mix, or shift to **PSQ** (unlevered short QQQ) which reduces market exposure without going to cash. Nuclear does incorporate bond ETFs in its decision logic (e.g., checking **TLT** or **IEF** RSI as indicators), but it **does not directly allocate** to TLT or cash – it stays in some form of market position (long or short) even in defensive mode. The only quasi-cash position in Nuclear is via BTAL, which is market-neutral (zero beta) but not risk-free. In summary, TECL strategy has a heavier use of **true cash/bonds for capital preservation**, whereas Nuclear strategy prefers **hedging instruments** and maintained exposure (short or market-neutral funds) over sitting in cash.

* **Volatility Hedging:** Both strategies employ **UVXY (VIX short-term futures ETF)** as a hedge/tactical asset, but in slightly different ways. **TECL strategy** brings in UVXY primarily at extreme market highs as a small allocation alongside cash – e.g. 25% UVXY with 75% BIL, in anticipation of a volatility spike or correction. It also has a trigger in deeper bear mode where if volatility (UVXY RSI) gets very high (>84), it will hold a small **15% UVXY and 85% BIL** position – essentially a tail-risk hedge with most capital still in cash. **Nuclear strategy** utilizes UVXY more heavily: at high RSI triggers, it can go **100% UVXY** (if extreme) or a large **75% UVXY position (with 25% BTAL)** as a default hedge when markets are just moderately overbought. Thus, Nuclear leans on volatility spikes for protection to a greater degree (devoting a larger portion of the portfolio to UVXY during danger signals). Both strategies will suffer the decay and drag of UVXY if they enter these hedges too early, but they incorporate it as an aggressive insurance policy. The difference is in sizing: TECL’s UVXY exposure is capped and usually paired mostly with cash, whereas Nuclear’s UVXY exposure is larger (75–100%) but partially mitigated by pairing with BTAL (which can cushion some equity risk). Notably, both **do** deploy UVXY around similar conditions (high RSI readings on indexes), meaning they share this hedge approach in principle.

## Drawdown Correlation and Risk Overlap

We examine whether these strategies might experience losses at the same time due to shared exposures or signals. Despite their different focus (tech vs. nuclear stocks), there are several scenarios where **their behaviors align**, potentially causing correlated drawdowns:

* **Joint Risk-On Exposure:** During **bullish uptrends** (SPY above 200-day MA) with no extreme overbought signals, each strategy takes on equity risk – though in different sectors. TECL\_for\_the\_long\_term will be **fully invested in TECL (leveraged tech)**, while Nuclear will be invested in **nuclear energy equities** (via its top 3 momentum picks). In a broad market rally, tech and nuclear stocks may both rise, but if a sudden market correction hits, **both portfolios would be long high-volatility equities at the same time**, likely suffering drawdowns together. However, the magnitude and correlation depend on the event – a tech-specific crash would hit TECL much harder, whereas Nuclear’s diversified stock picks might behave differently. Generally, in a sharp S\&P or NASDAQ correction, both strategies’ risk-on positions (tech and nuclear sector) would draw down simultaneously (both are pro-cyclical sectors). This is a period of *correlated vulnerability*: neither strategy is hedged until their triggers react, so an abrupt drop before the next rebalance would impact both.

* **Overbought Market Peaks (Pre-Correction):** Interestingly, at **extreme market highs**, both strategies tend to *preemptively hedge* in a similar way – by shifting into **UVXY** (long volatility). For example, if RSI levels are very high, TECL strategy moves to UVXY + cash, and Nuclear moves to UVXY (with BTAL). This means just prior to a potential downturn, both could be in similar positions (holding UVXY). If the anticipated correction occurs, this hedge should profit or limit damage for both. But if the market keeps grinding upward longer than expected (a continued melt-up), UVXY will decay and both strategies could suffer minor drawdowns simultaneously from being in UVXY too early. Thus, there’s correlation in that *both could underperform during an late-stage rally* due to carrying UVXY. They share the timing of this hedge (triggered by similar overbought RSI conditions), so both might see losses if the signal was premature. On the flip side, if the signal is timely and a volatility spike happens, both would profit from UVXY concurrently, which is a positive correlation in gains.

* **Oversold Downturns and Rebound Trades:** In pronounced sell-offs, when RSI signals hit oversold thresholds, **both strategies flip to leveraged long positions at roughly the same time**. TECL\_for\_the\_long\_term will buy TECL or SPXL (3× bull ETFs) on an RSI < 30 signal, and Nuclear will buy TQQQ or UPRO on similar signals. This means during a market **bottom-fishing attempt**, both are net long leveraged equities together. If the market continues to fall or remains volatile (a false bottom), these rebound trades could incur drawdowns simultaneously for both strategies. They essentially share the risk of a failed contrarian call – a further leg down would hurt both TECL’s newly acquired long and Nuclear’s long. If the rebound does occur, both benefit simultaneously. In essence, their oversold entry logic is very aligned (both use \~30 RSI on major indices), so they likely enter and exit these rebound trades around the same periods, resulting in correlated performance (good or bad) during market inflection points.

* **Prolonged Bear Markets:** In extended downtrends (SPY below 200MA for long periods), both strategies adopt a **bearish posture**, often involving short positions on tech. TECL’s strategy, after exhausting contrarian longs, can allocate to **SQQQ (3× short NASDAQ)** or stay in bonds/cash when tech momentum is weak. Nuclear’s default in a bear phase is to hold **short QQQ exposure** (via SQQQ or PSQ) across its Bear 1 and Bear 2 sub-strategies. This implies that for much of a downtrend, **both are effectively short the NASDAQ**. If the market experiences a fast bear-market rally (a sharp interim bounce), both could incur losses simultaneously – TECL might be short (SQQQ) and Nuclear is short via SQQQ/PSQ, so both would whipsaw at the same time as the market spikes upward unexpectedly. Conversely, in a grinding decline, both would profit from their short exposure concurrently. The correlation here is that both have significant **short tech exposure in bearish times**, meaning any event that reverses the bear trend unexpectedly can cause simultaneous drawdowns (they’d both need to stop out or flip their shorts, which their RSI signals would eventually do, but interim losses could align).

* **Diversifying Factors:** Despite the overlaps, there are factors that could cause divergences in performance. Nuclear’s focus on nuclear energy stocks vs. TECL’s focus on tech means that in some periods one sector might rally while the other lags. For example, during a tech correction that is sector-specific (not broad market), TECL strategy might go risk-off or lose value, while Nuclear’s portfolio in uranium/nuclear stocks might not be as affected (thus avoiding a drawdown). Likewise, Nuclear’s use of **BTAL and the blending of two bear sub-strategies (inverse-vol weighting)** might smooth its performance in ways TECL’s more straightforward approach (often all-in cash or all-in short) does not. TECL sitting in cash (BIL) at times can completely sidestep market volatility, whereas Nuclear’s constant exposure means it could still have small losses or gains when TECL is flat. These differences can reduce correlation over the long run. However, at major turning points and crises, the shared reliance on leveraged tech positions and volatility hedges means **their big moves can coincide**.

In summary, while the day-to-day holdings differ (tech ETF vs. nuclear stocks, cash vs. BTAL, etc.), **the critical risk-on and risk-off pivots often overlap**. Both strategies will tend to be **risk-on together (either long equities or leveraged ETFs) and risk-off together (volatility hedges or shorts)** based on similar market signals. Therefore, they are likely to experience **drawdowns in the same market conditions** – e.g. a sudden crash would catch both in long positions (before signals flip), a prolonged bear market will see both short and vulnerable to bear market rallies, and late-stage rallies might see both holding UVXY hedges that bleed value. Their **correlation is highest at the extremes** (where both respond to overbought/oversold signals similarly), whereas in mild or sector-specific moves their different asset focuses can lead to divergence.

| **Entry/Exit Triggers & Logic**                                 | *Trend filter:* Uses SPY > 200-day MA to toggle bull vs bear regime. *Overbought exit:* RSI(10) thresholds on tech indices trigger risk-off – e.g. TQQQ RSI > \~79 or SPY RSI > 80 causes shift to hedges (UVXY + cash). *Oversold entry:* RSI < \~30 on NASDAQ/S\&P triggers contrarian long (TECL or SPXL). Also uses **XLK vs KMLM RSI** to decide tech exposure: favors TECL if tech momentum > managed futures, or stays in cash if tech is lagging (unless extremely oversold). Overall, rules are mainly based on RSI of tech and broad market, plus one cross-asset momentum comparison (XLK vs KMLM).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | *Trend filter:* Also checks SPY > 200-day MA inside logic to choose “Bull” (nuclear equity portfolio) or “Bear” strategy. *Overbought exit:* Multi-layer RSI triggers on various indices – e.g. SPY, IOO (global), TQQQ (tech), VTV (value), XLF (financials), VOX (communications). Any 10-day RSI > \~79 starts hedging: if > 81 on any major index -> 100% UVXY, otherwise 75% UVXY/25% BTAL mix. *Oversold entry:* RSI < \~30 on TQQQ prompts long TQQQ, on SPY prompts long UPRO. Uses additional logic in bear mode: checks QQQ 60-day return for deep bear, QQQ 20-day MA trend, and compares bond vs short ETF momentum (RSI of TLT or IEF vs PSQ) to time switches between short and long positions. Logic is more complex, integrating multiple indices and relative momentum (equities vs bonds) in decision-making.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

TECL provides leveraged exposure to the tech sector (XLK). If broad market dips but tech is oversold, may also go long **SPXL** (3× S\&P 500). Does not pick individual stocks – exposure is via broad tech or S\&P ETFs for growth. Focus is on capturing tech sector upside with leverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Allocates to **Nuclear Energy equities** in bull mode. Implements a “Nuclear Energy Portfolio” group selecting top 3 names (e.g. SMR, BWXT, LEU, EXC, NLR, OKLO) by 90-day momentum, weighted by inverse volatility. This gives a concentrated bet on the nuclear/uranium sector. No direct tech ETF exposure during normal uptrends – instead, rides a thematic basket. Also not limited to one ETF: holds multiple stock positions (for diversification within the theme). Leverages equity growth via stock selection rather than index ETFs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Protective/Hedging Allocations (Risk-Off or Bear Positions)** | Frequently moves to **safe assets** when risk signals flash. In mild risk-off it holds **BIL** (T-Bill ETF, essentially cash) either fully or in large part. At extreme overbought levels, hedges with **UVXY + BIL** (typically 25% in UVXY, 75% in cash) to profit from volatility spikes while mostly preserving capital. In prolonged bear phase, if not attempting a contrarian long, it may either stay in bonds (**BSV**) or take a **short position via SQQQ** depending on short-term momentum (chooses SQQQ vs BSV by RSI filter). Thus risk-off exposure is a mix of cash, Treasury assets, and occasionally inverse NASDAQ. **UVXY** is used sparingly (small allocation) as a hedge for sharp drops, and cash is a big component of drawdown management.                                                                                       | Emphasizes **hedged or inverse positions** rather than cash. At overbought signals, shifts heavily into **UVXY** (75–100% allocation, with remaining in BTAL) to short volatility, and **BTAL** (market-neutral anti-beta fund) provides a hedge that gains when high-beta stocks underperform. Rarely holds cash outright; instead uses **PSQ** (−1× Short QQQ) as a lower-risk short position when full leverage isn’t warranted. In bear mode, default is to be short via **SQQQ** (−3× NASDAQ) for market declines, sometimes tempered with PSQ. Combines two sub-strategies (Bear 1 & Bear 2) with different conditions (one might flip long in certain oversold cases, the other stays short) and allocates between them based on volatility, which provides partial hedging of timing risk. **Bond ETFs (TLT/IEF)** are not held directly but their momentum influences decisions – e.g. if bonds are stronger than shorts, Nuclear might pivot to a long QQQ position. Overall, Nuclear stays **invested in some defensive position** (shorts or volatility or market-neutral) rather than sitting in cash, aiming to actively profit in downturns. |
| **Likely Simultaneous Exposures / Correlated Periods**          | – **Both long leveraged tech during rebounds:** e.g. after a steep sell-off, both may hold leveraged NASDAQ/S\&P longs (TECL/SPXL in TECL strategy, TQQQ/UPRO in Nuclear) expecting a bounce. <br> – **Both short or hedged in deep bear markets:** both will have short NASDAQ exposure (SQQQ) at times during prolonged declines, aligning their bearish bets. <br> – **Both long volatility at market peaks:** when RSI signals are high, both allocate to UVXY (TECL with partial cash, Nuclear with BTAL) in anticipation of a correction. <br> – These overlaps mean their performance can sync in stress events (e.g. a surprise rally or drop affects both similarly when they share positions). However, TECL’s use of cash vs. Nuclear’s continuous exposure can cause divergence in mild conditions (TECL may sit out of the market more often). | – **Same as TECL column:** The Nuclear strategy’s overlapping exposure points are the mirror of TECL’s: both go risk-on or risk-off around the same times due to similar signals (as detailed in left column). <br> – Notably, Nuclear’s unique stock focus might decouple returns in stock-specific rallies/slumps (e.g. tech vs. energy sector moves), but major market-driven moves see high correlation between the strategies’ exposures. <br> – Both strategies are likely to experience drawdowns **simultaneously** in a broad market downturn (initial phase) or a whipsaw, since both would be positioned in risk assets (long) or both in shorts/vol hedges at the same junctures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

In conclusion, **TECL\_for\_the\_long\_term** and **Nuclear** share a common framework of trend filtering and RSI-triggered shifts between leveraged bullish positions and defensive stances. They both utilize instruments like UVXY for hedging and SQQQ for short exposure, which leads to parallel behavior in critical moments. Their key differences lie in *where* they seek returns (broad tech ETF vs. specific nuclear stocks) and how they manage off-risk capital (true cash/bonds vs. alternative hedges). These differences might yield different performance in sector-specific situations, but the high-level mechanics are sufficiently similar that their **behaviour and risks can be correlated**, especially during market extremes when both strategies respond to the same technical signals. The comparison table above summarizes the mechanics and highlights where the strategies converge or diverge in exposure and risk handling.
