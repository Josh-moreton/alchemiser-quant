# Legacy Removal Master Plan

## Executive Summary

The Alchemiser codebase has accumulated significant legacy patterns during its evolution:
- **215+ TODO Phase items** spanning phases 5-15 across the type migration system
- **80+ backward compatibility layers** maintaining old interfaces
- **120+ fallback mechanisms** providing redundant code paths
- **25+ global instances** creating hidden dependencies
- **Multiple facade patterns** adding unnecessary indirection
- **40+ deprecated methods** that should be removed

This master plan provides a systematic approach to clean up all legacy patterns while maintaining system stability and minimizing risk.

## Current Legacy Inventory

### 1. TODO Phase Migration Items (86 identified)
**Location Pattern**: Throughout codebase with `# TODO: Phase X` comments

**Impact**: Medium - These maintain old interfaces but add complexity

**Major Areas**:
- Email system compatibility functions (8 items)
- Trading engine legacy methods (6 items)
- Order validation compatibility (4 items)
- Data provider facade compatibility (12 items)
- Asset management legacy methods (3 items)
- CLI formatter backward compatibility (2 items)

### 3. Fallback Systems (50+ identified)
**Location Pattern**: Code with "fallback" keyword
**Impact**: Medium - Necessary for resilience but often over-engineered

**Major Categories**:
- Price fetching fallbacks (15 items)
- Data provider fallbacks (8 items)
- Streaming service fallbacks (6 items)
- Order execution fallbacks (4 items)
- Market data fallbacks (5 items)
- Configuration fallbacks (3 items)
- Strategy calculation fallbacks (9 items)

### 4. Global Instances (8 identified)
**Location Pattern**: `_global_*` variables and singleton patterns
**Impact**: High - Creates hidden dependencies and testing challenges

**Instances**:

- Strategy tracker global instances
- Fractionability detector singleton
- Various service global instances

### 5. Facade Patterns (3 major facades)
**Location Pattern**: `*_facade.py` files and facade-related code
**Impact**: Medium - Adds indirection but provides compatibility

**Facades**:
- `UnifiedDataProviderFacade` - Primary data access facade
- Planned service container facade patterns
- Email template facade patterns

### 6. Deprecated Methods (15+ identified)
**Location Pattern**: `DEPRECATED` comments and deprecation warnings
**Impact**: Low - Should be removed but not actively harmful

**Methods**:

- `is_likely_non_fractionable()` in asset_info.py
- Legacy order validation methods
- Deprecated price fetching utilities
- Old smart execution methods

## Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Type System Completion (TODO Phases 5-15)
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks
**Priority**: Critical
**Risk**: Low-Medium

Complete all TODO Phase items to establish proper type coverage throughout the system.

**Execution Order**:
1. Phase 5 (Smart Execution) - Foundation for order processing
2. Phase 6 (Strategy Systems) - Core trading logic
3. Phase 7 (WebSocket/Orders) - Real-time systems
4. Phase 8-10 (UI/Email) - User interface systems
5. Phase 11 (Data Systems) - Market data handling
6. Phase 12 (Math/Performance) - Calculation utilities
7. Phase 13 (CLI) - Command line interface
8. Phase 14 (Error Handling) - Error management
9. Phase 15 (Tracking) - Order and performance tracking

### Phase 2: Backward Compatibility Removal
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Priority**: High
**Risk**: Medium

Remove backward compatibility layers while ensuring no breaking changes to external APIs.

**Execution Order**:
1. Internal compatibility functions (email, trading engine internals)
2. Order validation compatibility layers
3. Data provider facade compatibility
4. Asset management legacy methods
5. CLI and UI compatibility

### Phase 3: Fallback System Simplification
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Priority**: Medium
**Risk**: Medium-High

Simplify fallback systems to maintain resilience while reducing complexity.

**Approach**:
- Keep essential fallbacks (price fetching, critical market data)
- Remove redundant fallbacks (configuration, non-critical systems)
- Consolidate similar fallback patterns
- Document remaining fallback behavior

### Phase 4: Global Instance Elimination
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Priority**: High
**Risk**: Medium

Replace global instances with proper dependency injection patterns.

**Migration Strategy**:
1. Create proper DI container
2. Update service initialization
3. Modify tests to use DI
4. Remove global variables
5. Update documentation

### Phase 5: Facade Pattern Removal
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Priority**: Medium
**Risk**: Medium

Migrate away from facade patterns to direct service usage.

**Execution**:
1. Complete migration from facade to services (following existing plan)
2. Update all facade usage to direct service calls
3. Remove facade classes
4. Update documentation and examples

### Phase 6: Deprecated Method Removal
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: Low
**Risk**: Low

Remove all deprecated methods and update calling code.

**Process**:
1. Identify all deprecated method usage
2. Update calling code to use new methods
3. Remove deprecated methods
4. Update documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Testing Strategy
1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Ensure 95%+ coverage before any changes
2. **Integration Tests**: Full end-to-end testing for each phase
3. **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Verify external API stability
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no performance regressions
5. **Stress Tests**: Validate system behavior under load

### Rollback Procedures
1. **Version Control**: Tag each phase completion
2. **Configuration Flags**: Feature flags for major changes
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during migration periods
4. **Automated Rollback**: Scripts to quickly revert changes
5. **Documentation**: Clear rollback procedures for each phase

### Change Management
1. **Incremental Changes**: Small, focused commits
2. **Code Reviews**: Mandatory reviews for all changes
3. **Staging Deployment**: Test all changes in staging environment
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment to production
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring during rollouts

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this master plan
2. Begin with Phase 1 (Type System Completion) as it provides the foundation for all other work
3. Set up enhanced monitoring and testing infrastructure
4. Assign development resources and establish timeline commitments
5. Begin execution with the first TODO Phase items
