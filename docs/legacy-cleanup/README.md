# Legacy Cleanup Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for removing all legacy methods, fallbacks, and backward compatibility patterns from The Alchemiser trading system.

## Documents Overview

1. **[Legacy Removal Master Plan](./LEGACY_REMOVAL_MASTER_PLAN.md)** - Complete overview and execution strategy
2. **[Phase TODO Migration Plan](./PHASE_TODO_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)** - Detailed plan for all TODO Phase items
3. **[Backward Compatibility Cleanup](./BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY_CLEANUP.md)** - Removal of backward compatibility layers
4. **[Fallback Systems Cleanup](./FALLBACK_SYSTEMS_CLEANUP.md)** - Systematic removal of fallback mechanisms
5. **[Global Instances Cleanup](./GLOBAL_INSTANCES_CLEANUP.md)** - Migration from global instances to dependency injection
6. **[Facade Pattern Removal](./FACADE_PATTERN_REMOVAL.md)** - Complete migration away from facade patterns
7. **[Deprecated Methods Removal](./DEPRECATED_METHODS_REMOVAL.md)** - Systematic removal of all deprecated methods

## Execution Strategy

The cleanup is designed to be executed in phases to minimize risk and maintain system stability:

1. **Phase 1**: Type system completion (TODO Phase items 5-15)
2. **Phase 2**: Backward compatibility removal
3. **Phase 3**: Fallback system simplification
4. **Phase 4**: Global instance elimination
5. **Phase 5**: Facade pattern removal
6. **Phase 6**: Final cleanup and validation

## Risk Mitigation

- Each phase includes comprehensive testing requirements
- Rollback procedures are documented for each change
- Migration is designed to maintain API stability where possible
- Breaking changes are clearly identified and documented

## Benefits After Cleanup

- **Simplified Codebase**: Removal of redundant patterns and legacy code paths
- **Better Performance**: Elimination of unnecessary indirection and fallback overhead
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clearer code structure without legacy cruft
- **Enhanced Testability**: Direct dependency injection instead of global state
- **Type Safety**: Complete type coverage without legacy Any types
- **Reduced Complexity**: Single responsibility patterns throughout

## Getting Started

1. Read the [Legacy Removal Master Plan](./LEGACY_REMOVAL_MASTER_PLAN.md) for the complete overview
2. Choose a specific area to work on based on your priorities
3. Follow the detailed instructions in the relevant document
4. Execute tests and validation procedures as outlined
5. Submit changes incrementally with proper testing

## Status Tracking

Each document includes a status tracking section to monitor progress on the cleanup efforts.
