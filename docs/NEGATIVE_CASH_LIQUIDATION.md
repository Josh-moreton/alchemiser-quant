# Negative Cash Balance Liquidation

## Overview

This feature automatically liquidates all positions when the portfolio detects a negative or zero cash balance. After liquidation, if the cash balance becomes positive, the system continues with normal trading operations. If cash remains negative, trading is prevented.

## Implementation

### Flow

1. **Detection**: The `PortfolioStateReader.build_portfolio_snapshot()` method checks the cash balance
2. **Liquidation**: If cash ≤ 0, it calls `liquidate_all_positions()` to close all open positions
3. **Re-check**: After liquidation, positions and cash balance are re-fetched
4. **Decision**: 
   - If cash > 0: Continue with normal trading (snapshot creation proceeds)
   - If cash ≤ 0: Raise `NegativeCashBalanceError` to prevent further trading

### API Chain

```
PortfolioStateReader.build_portfolio_snapshot()
  ↓
AlpacaDataAdapter.liquidate_all_positions()
  ↓
AlpacaManager.close_all_positions(cancel_orders=True)
  ↓
AlpacaTradingService.close_all_positions(cancel_orders=True)
  ↓
Alpaca TradingClient.close_all_positions(cancel_orders=True)
```

## Key Components

### 1. TradingRepository Protocol
Location: `the_alchemiser/shared/protocols/repository.py`

Added method signature:
```python
def close_all_positions(self, cancel_orders: bool = True) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Liquidate all positions for an account."""
```

### 2. AlpacaTradingService
Location: `the_alchemiser/shared/services/alpaca_trading_service.py`

Implements the Alpaca API call:
- Calls `self._trading_client.close_all_positions(cancel_orders=cancel_orders)`
- Handles various response formats (list of objects, dicts, etc.)
- Returns list of closed position responses
- Graceful error handling with empty list on failure

### 3. AlpacaManager
Location: `the_alchemiser/shared/brokers/alpaca_manager.py`

Delegates to trading service:
```python
def close_all_positions(self, cancel_orders: bool = True) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    return self._get_trading_service().close_all_positions(cancel_orders=cancel_orders)
```

### 4. AlpacaDataAdapter
Location: `the_alchemiser/portfolio_v2/adapters/alpaca_data_adapter.py`

Provides portfolio-specific interface:
```python
def liquidate_all_positions(self) -> bool:
    """Liquidate all positions by calling Alpaca's close_all_positions API."""
```
- Returns boolean success/failure
- Comprehensive logging at WARNING level for liquidation events
- Catches and logs exceptions

### 5. PortfolioStateReader
Location: `the_alchemiser/portfolio_v2/core/state_reader.py`

Orchestrates the liquidation:
- Detects negative/zero cash balance
- Calls `liquidate_all_positions()`
- Re-fetches positions and cash balance after liquidation
- If cash > 0: Continues with snapshot creation (allows trading)
- If cash ≤ 0: Raises `NegativeCashBalanceError` to prevent trading

## Behavior

### When Negative Cash is Detected

1. **Log Error**: "Account has non-positive cash balance: ${cash}. Attempting to liquidate all positions."
2. **Call Liquidation API**: Alpaca's `close_all_positions(cancel_orders=True)`
3. **Log Result**: Success or failure of liquidation
4. **Re-fetch Data**: Get updated positions and cash balance
5. **Decision Point**:
   - **Cash > 0**: Log success message and continue with trading
   - **Cash ≤ 0**: Raise `NegativeCashBalanceError` to prevent further trading

### Parameters

- `cancel_orders=True`: Also cancels all open orders before liquidating positions
  - This ensures no new positions are created during liquidation

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **No Positions**: API returns empty list, handled gracefully
2. **API Failure**: Exception caught and logged, raises error
3. **Still Negative After**: Logs warning and raises error
4. **Positive Cash After Liquidation**: Continues with normal trading flow
5. **Positive Cash Initially**: Skips liquidation entirely

## Testing

### Test Coverage

1. **test_negative_cash_liquidation.py** (Portfolio Module)
   - Negative cash triggers liquidation and continues if recovery succeeds
   - Zero cash triggers liquidation and continues if recovery succeeds
   - Liquidation with cash still negative raises error
   - Liquidation with API failures
   - No positions to liquidate
   - Positive cash skips liquidation

2. **test_close_all_positions.py** (Shared Services)
   - List response handling
   - Dict response handling
   - Empty result handling
   - Exception handling
   - Default parameter values

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/portfolio_v2/test_negative_cash_liquidation.py -v

## Example Logs

### Successful Liquidation with Recovery

```
2024-10-02 10:30:00 - ERROR - Account has non-positive cash balance: $-100.50. Attempting to liquidate all positions.

2024-10-02 10:30:03 - INFO - Cash balance recovered after liquidation: $50.00. Continuing with trading.
```

### Liquidation with Cash Still Negative

```
2024-10-02 10:30:00 - ERROR - Account has non-positive cash balance: $-100.50. Attempting to liquidate all positions.
2024-10-02 10:30:01 - INFO - Closing all positions (cancel_orders=True)...
2024-10-02 10:30:02 - INFO - Successfully closed 2 positions
2024-10-02 10:30:02 - INFO - Successfully liquidated 2 positions
2024-10-02 10:30:02 - INFO - Liquidation completed. Re-checking cash balance and positions...
2024-10-02 10:30:03 - ERROR - Cash balance still non-positive after liquidation: $-10.00
2024-10-02 10:30:03 - ERROR - Account cash balance is $-10.00 after liquidation. Trading cannot proceed.
```

### Failed Liquidation

```
2024-10-02 10:30:00 - ERROR - Account has non-positive cash balance: $-100.50. Attempting to liquidate all positions.
2024-10-02 10:30:01 - ERROR - Failed to close all positions: API Error
2024-10-02 10:30:01 - ERROR - Failed to liquidate all positions: API Error
2024-10-02 10:30:01 - ERROR - Account cash balance is $-100.50 and liquidation failed. Trading cannot proceed.
```

## Safety Guarantees

1. **Continues Trading After Recovery**: If liquidation succeeds and cash becomes positive, trading continues normally
2. **Prevents Trading on Failure**: If cash remains negative after liquidation, trading is prevented
3. **Idempotent**: Can be called multiple times safely
4. **Traceable**: All actions logged with correlation IDs
5. **Non-Blocking**: If liquidation fails, the error is raised to prevent further damage
