current-price,current-price,current_price,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,"N/A (returns prices.iloc[-1])",close_only,yes,true,"Returns the latest close price from the bar series. When live bar is appended, returns today's close-so-far.","No modifications needed. Already works with partial bars because it simply returns the latest close value regardless of completeness.","Stale price if market closed and cache not updated|Pre-market/after-hours price may differ from regular session"
rsi,rsi,rsi,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,TechnicalIndicators.rsi,close_only,conditional,true,"Computes RSI using Wilder's smoothing over close prices. Uses ewm() which processes all bars including the latest.","Works with partial bar but RSI will be more volatile intraday. The partial bar's close-so-far contributes to the gain/loss calculation. Consider adding metadata flag to indicate partial bar was used.","RSI may jump significantly near market open when close-so-far equals open|Intraday RSI variance higher than end-of-day due to price swings|Early in session (first 30 min), high/low may not yet be established"
moving-average-price,moving-average-price,moving_average,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,TechnicalIndicators.moving_average,close_only,yes,true,"Computes simple moving average over close prices using rolling().mean(). Requires min_periods=window to produce non-NaN values.","Works with partial bar. The partial close contributes 1/N weight to the average. Effect is minimal for large windows (e.g., 200-day).","For short windows (5-20 days), partial bar has higher relative impact|Gap up/down at open creates larger deviation from yesterday's close-based MA"
exponential-moving-average-price,exponential-moving-average-price,exponential_moving_average_price,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,TechnicalIndicators.exponential_moving_average,close_only,conditional,true,"Computes EMA using ewm(span=window). More weight on recent prices means partial bar has higher influence than in SMA.","EMA is recursive: EMA_t = α*P_t + (1-α)*EMA_{t-1}. More naturally updated intraday than SMA. If SMA uses live bar, EMA should too.","EMA crossover signals may flip intraday then revert by close|For EMA-8 vs SMA-10 comparisons, timing of evaluation matters significantly"
moving-average-return,moving-average-return,moving_average_return,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,TechnicalIndicators.moving_average_return,close_only,conditional,true,"Computes rolling mean of pct_change(). The partial bar's return (close-so-far vs yesterday's close) is included in the average.","Works but today's return is incomplete. Early in session, today's return is (close-so-far / yesterday_close - 1) which may not reflect final daily return. Impact depends on window size.","Morning volatility causes today's return to swing significantly|Rolling average may differ from EOD value if session ends differently"
cumulative-return,cumulative-return,cumulative_return,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,TechnicalIndicators.cumulative_return,close_only,yes,true,"Computes ((current_price / price_N_days_ago) - 1) * 100. Uses shift(window) to get historical reference price.","Cumulative return at 15:45 is (P_t / P_start) - 1. If we can use P_t for moving_average_return, we can use it here too.","Reference price (N days ago) must be from a completed bar|For window=60, comparing to price from ~3 months ago is stable"
stdev-return,stdev-return,stdev_return,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,TechnicalIndicators.stdev_return,close_only,conditional,true,"Computes rolling std of pct_change(). Today's return (close-so-far vs yesterday) is included in the volatility calculation.","Works but today's incomplete return may skew volatility. If today has unusually high intraday range, stdev will spike. For short windows (6 days), this effect is pronounced.","Flash crash or spike intraday inflates volatility reading|Near market open, return is small (close-so-far ≈ open)|Volatility reading changes significantly throughout the day"
stdev-price,stdev-price,stdev_price,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,TechnicalIndicators.stdev_price,close_only,conditional,true,"Computes rolling std of raw close prices. Today's close-so-far is included in the standard deviation calculation.","If we accept P_t for stdev_return, we should accept it for stdev_price too. Excluding one while including the other is arbitrary.","Large gap up/down increases price stdev immediately at open|Trending price action may show lower stdev than mean-reverting action"
max-drawdown,max-drawdown,max_drawdown,functions.strategy_worker.indicators.indicators,TechnicalIndicators.max_drawdown,close_only,yes,true,"Computes rolling max drawdown using cummax(). Today's close-so-far extends the price series for peak-to-trough calculation.","Drawdown at time t is (P_t / max(P_≤t)) - 1. Can be updated with live price. Reflects real-time risk exposure as intended.","Intraday drawdown may exceed EOD drawdown if price recovers later|New all-time high intraday resets drawdown to 0 even if price falls later"
