# Financial-Grade Code Audits

This directory contains comprehensive, institution-level code audits for critical trading system components.

## Purpose

Each audit provides a rigorous, line-by-line review following financial industry standards for:
- Correctness and contracts
- Security and compliance
- Observability and tracing
- Error handling and resilience
- Testing and validation
- Performance and complexity

## Audit Standards

All audits follow the guidelines in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](../../.github/copilot-instructions.md) and evaluate:

1. **Architecture** - Single responsibility, module boundaries, dependencies
2. **Correctness** - Type safety, numerical accuracy, business logic
3. **Security** - Credential handling, input validation, secrets management
4. **Error Handling** - Typed exceptions, context, idempotency
5. **Observability** - Structured logging, correlation IDs, metrics
6. **Testing** - Coverage, property-based tests, determinism
7. **Performance** - Complexity metrics, I/O patterns, resource usage
8. **Compliance** - Coding standards, documentation, best practices

## Audit Format

Each audit includes:

### Full Audit Report (`AUDIT_*.md`)
- **Metadata**: File path, criticality, dependencies, services touched
- **Scope & Objectives**: What was reviewed and why
