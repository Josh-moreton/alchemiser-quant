## 2) Summary of Findings

### Critical
1. **SECURITY: Credentials stored in plain text** (Lines 61-62) - API keys and secrets stored as instance attributes without redaction in logs or memory protection
2. **SECURITY: Credentials exposed in singleton key** (Line 43) - Credentials concatenated into dictionary key, potentially logged or exposed in health checks

### High
3. **ERROR HANDLING: Generic RuntimeError** (Line 105) - Should use typed exception from `shared.errors`
4. **OBSERVABILITY: Missing correlation_id** (Throughout) - No correlation/causation IDs for tracing operations across system
5. **OBSERVABILITY: F-string formatting in logs** (Lines 82, 111, 123, 183, 195) - Should use structured logging with separate fields
6. **RACE CONDITION: Instance creation** (Lines 45-54) - Small window between `_cleanup_in_progress` check and instance creation

### Medium
7. **THREAD SAFETY: Busy-wait pattern** (Lines 47-48) - `time.sleep(0.001)` polling could be replaced with threading.Event
8. **ERROR HANDLING: Silent max() fallback** (Lines 121, 193) - Reference count errors silently clamped to 0
9. **OBSERVABILITY: Limited error context** (Lines 164, 177, 209, 298) - Exceptions logged without operation context
10. **TESTING: No test coverage** - No dedicated test file for this critical component
11. **DOCSTRINGS: Missing pre/post conditions** - Methods lack failure modes, exceptions raised, thread-safety guarantees
12. **RESOURCE CLEANUP: No timeout on stop()** (Lines 207, 288) - `stream.stop()` calls have no timeout, could hang indefinitely

### Low
13. **TYPING: TYPE_CHECKING import** (Line 20-21) - TradingStream only imported for type checking, but used at runtime (line 144)
14. **NAMING: Inconsistent private attributes** - Some use single underscore, should be consistent
15. **COMPLEXITY: Nested inner function** (Lines 153-167) - `_runner()` function inside method adds cognitive complexity
16. **LOGGING: Mixed emoji/structured logging** - Inconsistent logging style throughout

### Info/Nits
17. **MODULE HEADER: Correct format** (Lines 1-8) - Properly formatted business unit header ✅
18. **TYPE HINTS: Complete and accurate** - All public methods have proper type hints ✅
19. **COMPLEXITY: Excellent scores** - Average cyclomatic complexity 3.58 (A rating) ✅
20. **FILE SIZE: Within limits** - 303 lines (target ≤500, split >800) ✅
21. **MYPY: Clean pass** - No type errors ✅
22. **RUFF: Clean pass** - No linting issues ✅

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Single responsibility: WebSocket connection lifecycle management
  
- [ ] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ⚠️ Missing: failure modes, thread-safety guarantees, exceptions raised
  
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ All methods have type hints; minimal `Any` usage (only in callbacks)
  
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - ✅ No DTOs in this file (connection manager)
  
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ✅ No numerical operations in this file
  
- [ ] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ❌ Uses generic `RuntimeError` and `Exception`
  - ❌ Silent error correction with `max(0, ...)`
  
- [ ] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ⚠️ Reference counting assumes sequential calls; no idempotency keys
  
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ Deterministic (but no tests exist)
  
- [ ] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ❌ **CRITICAL**: Credentials stored in plain text and used in dictionary keys
  - ❌ Credentials potentially logged in debug statements
  
- [ ] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ❌ No correlation_id tracking
  - ❌ F-string formatting instead of structured logging fields
  
- [ ] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ❌ **No test file exists** for this critical component
  
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ No performance issues; proper singleton pattern
  
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ **Excellent**: Average complexity 3.58 (A rating)
  - ✅ All methods < 50 lines
  - ✅ All methods ≤ 5 parameters
  
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ 303 lines (well within limits)
  
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ Clean import structure

**Overall Score: 12/16 (75%)**

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Credential Security** - Must redact/hash credentials
2. **Error Handling** - Must use typed exceptions from `shared.errors`
3. **Testing** - Must add comprehensive test coverage
4. **Observability** - Must add correlation_id tracking and structured logging

---

## 5) Additional Notes

### Architecture Observations

The file implements a well-designed singleton pattern for managing WebSocket connections, preventing the common issue of connection limit exceeded errors. The reference counting mechanism is sound, though it could benefit from more defensive checks.

### Thread Safety

The implementation uses locks correctly for protecting shared state. However:
- The busy-wait pattern in `__new__` could be improved with `threading.Event`
- The `_runner` thread function could benefit from better lifecycle management
- No timeout protection on blocking `stop()` calls

### Security Concerns

**HIGH PRIORITY**: Credentials are stored in plain text throughout:
1. Instance attributes (`self.api_key`, `self.secret_key`)
2. Singleton dictionary keys (concatenated credentials)
3. Potentially logged in debug statements
4. Exposed in health check responses

**Recommendation**: Implement credential redaction/hashing immediately before production use.

### Testing Gaps

No dedicated test file exists (`test_websocket_manager.py` missing). Critical test scenarios needed:
- Singleton behavior with multiple credential sets
- Reference counting correctness
- Thread safety under concurrent access
- Cleanup behavior
- Service lifecycle (start/stop/restart)
- Error recovery scenarios

### Performance Considerations

The singleton pattern is efficient and prevents resource waste. The implementation scales well for multiple credential sets. No performance concerns identified.

### Compliance with Coding Standards

**Strong adherence** to project standards:
- ✅ Module header format correct
- ✅ Type hints complete
- ✅ Complexity metrics excellent
- ✅ File size appropriate
- ✅ Import organization clean
- ✅ Passes mypy and ruff checks

**Areas for improvement**:
- ❌ Structured logging not fully adopted
- ❌ Error handling uses generic exceptions
- ❌ Missing comprehensive docstrings
- ❌ No test coverage
