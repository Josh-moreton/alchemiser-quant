- External: `decimal` (stdlib), `datetime` (stdlib), `typing` (stdlib)

**External services touched**: None (pure computation)

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
- Consumed: DSLValue (union type from .types)
- Produced: Decimal, float, int, str (primitive types)

**Related docs/specs**:
- [Copilot Instructions](/.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- [Strategy V2 README](/the_alchemiser/strategy_v2/README.md)

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability ✅
- Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required ✅
- Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls ✅
- Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested ✅
- Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks** ✅

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical ✅ FIXED
- **Line 78 (original)**: Bare `except Exception` silently caught all exceptions, violating "no silent except" guardrail
- **Fixed**: Changed to catch specific `DecimalException` and `ValueError`, added structured logging with correlation context

### High ✅ FIXED
- **Lines 73-74 (original)**: Boolean handling bug - booleans treated as int, causing `Decimal(str(True))` → `Decimal("True")` → `InvalidOperation`
- **Fixed**: Added explicit boolean check BEFORE int/float check, returning `Decimal("1")` or `Decimal("0")`

### Medium ✅ FIXED
- **Line 94-95 (original)**: `isinstance(val, bool)` check in `coerce_param_value` unreachable due to bool being int subclass
- **Fixed**: Reordered checks to place boolean check FIRST before (float, int, Decimal, str) tuple check

### Low (Not Fixed - Design Decision)
- **Line 59**: `datetime.now(UTC)` not injectable/frozen for deterministic tests
- **Rationale**: Context creation is at test boundary; tests can freeze time at higher level if needed; timestamp primarily used for logging/trace metadata

### Info/Nits ✅ ADDRESSED
- **Docstrings**: Enhanced method docstrings with explicit documentation of edge cases, return semantics, and error handling
- **Imports**: Added `DecimalException` import for specific exception handling
- **Logging**: Added structured logger with correlation_id propagation

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - **Pass**: Single responsibility - type coercion utilities for DSL context
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - **Pass**: All methods have complete docstrings, enhanced with edge case documentation
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - **Pass**: All parameters and returns fully typed, using `DSLValue` union type
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - **N/A**: No DTOs in this file (utility class with methods)
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - **Pass**: Uses Decimal for numeric operations; converts floats via string to avoid precision loss
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - **Pass (after fix)**: Catches specific `(DecimalException, ValueError)`; logs with correlation_id, value, error details
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - **Pass**: Pure functions with no side-effects (except logging); deterministic for same input
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - **Partial**: `timestamp` uses `datetime.now(UTC)` but not critical for business logic; timestamp used only for trace metadata
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - **Pass**: No secrets, no eval/exec, input validation via isinstance checks
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - **Pass (after fix)**: Added structured logging for error cases with correlation_id propagation
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - **Pass**: 22 tests covering all methods including property-based tests; added tests for boolean edge cases
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - **Pass**: Pure computation, no I/O; simple isinstance checks and arithmetic
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - **Pass**: 
    - `__init__`: 5 params (acceptable), ~6 lines
    - `as_decimal`: ~25 lines, cyclomatic ~6, cognitive ~8
    - `coerce_param_value`: ~10 lines, cyclomatic ~5, cognitive ~6
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - **Pass**: 125 lines (well within limits)
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - **Pass**: Clean import structure, correct ordering

## 5) Additional Notes

### Code Quality Improvements Made

1. **Boolean Handling**: Fixed critical bug where boolean values would cause `InvalidOperation` when converted to Decimal. Now explicitly checks for bool type before int/float and returns appropriate Decimal values (1 or 0).

2. **Exception Handling**: Replaced bare `except Exception` with specific `(DecimalException, ValueError)` catch, added structured logging with context for debugging and audit trail.

3. **Type Check Ordering**: Fixed unreachable code issue in `coerce_param_value` where boolean check was unreachable due to bool being an int subclass. Reordered to check bool first.

4. **Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings with explicit edge case behavior, return value semantics, and error handling guarantees.

5. **Observability**: Added module-level logger and structured logging for error cases, including correlation_id, value, and error details for production debugging.

6. **Testing**: Added two new tests for boolean edge cases that were previously skipped due to the bug. All 22 tests now pass including property-based tests.

### Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for all methods (simple type checks and conversions)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (no data structures allocated proportional to input)
- **Hot Path Suitability**: Yes - suitable for hot paths; minimal overhead from isinstance checks

### Deployment Considerations

- **Breaking Changes**: None - behavior change for booleans is a bug fix, returns semantically correct values
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Full - all existing code using correct types (non-boolean) will behave identically
- **Migration Path**: None required - bug fix is transparent to callers

### Related Issues / Future Work

1. **Timestamp Injection**: Consider making `timestamp` injectable for more deterministic testing, though current approach is acceptable for trace metadata use case.

2. **Decimal Context**: Consider explicitly setting decimal context (precision, rounding mode) at module level for consistent behavior across environments.

3. **Type Narrowing**: Could use `typing.TypeGuard` or `typing.TypeIs` (Python 3.13+) for more precise type narrowing in isinstance checks.

## 6) Test Coverage

### Test Files
- `tests/strategy_v2/engines/dsl/test_context.py` (22 tests, 100% pass)

### Coverage Summary
- `as_decimal`: 10 tests (Decimal, int, float, string, invalid string, None, bool True/False, property-based)
- `coerce_param_value`: 8 tests (int, float, Decimal, string, bool, None, single-item list, multi-item list, dict, property-based)
- `__init__`: 1 test (attribute initialization)
- `evaluate_node`: 1 test (callable check)
- Property-based: 3 tests (precision preservation, never raises, always returns primitive)

### Test Results
```
================================================== 22 passed in 0.81s ==================================================

## 7) Audit Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED WITH FIXES APPLIED**

**Summary**: The file has been reviewed to institution-grade standards and found to be fundamentally sound with several critical and high-severity issues that have been successfully resolved. The code now meets all correctness, safety, and observability requirements outlined in the Copilot Instructions.

**Key Improvements**:
1. Fixed critical boolean handling bug that could cause runtime exceptions
2. Replaced bare exception handling with specific, logged exception handling
3. Fixed unreachable code issue in type coercion logic
4. Enhanced observability with structured logging
5. Improved documentation with explicit edge case behavior
6. Added comprehensive test coverage for boolean edge cases

**Remaining Considerations**:
- Timestamp injection for testing (low priority, acceptable as-is)
- Explicit decimal context configuration (informational, not required)

**Version**: Bumped from 2.9.0 → 2.9.1 (patch) per project guidelines
