  - 5-step migration process with concrete examples
  - Complete typed strategy implementation template
  - Strategy registration updates
  - Unit and integration testing patterns

### 3. reference/Feature-Flags.md (Updated - 162 lines)
- **Before**: Basic typed domain information
- **After**: Detailed typed domain documentation including:
  - Configuration options and default behavior

  - Monitoring and observability guidelines
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Key Content Highlights

### Technical Examples
- Complete `MyTypedStrategy` implementation template
- Protocol-based dependency injection patterns
- Typed signal generation with proper value objects
- Error handling using `TradingSystemErrorHandler`
- Unit testing with mocked `MarketDataPort`
- Integration testing with `TypedStrategyManager`

### Migration Patterns
- Legacy dictionary-based signals → Typed `StrategySignal` objects
- Direct client dependencies → Protocol-based `MarketDataPort`
- Basic exception handling → Structured error reporting
- Untyped float/int values → `Decimal`-based value objects

### Documentation Structure
- Clear hierarchical organization with cross-references
- Practical examples for every concept
- Step-by-step instructions with validation
- Troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Reference links between related documents

## Impact

### Trading Engine Decomposition Documentation
This comprehensive documentation provides:

1. **Complete Architectural Reference**: Developers can understand the full DDD-based trading system
2. **Refactoring Context**: Clear understanding of why and how the system was decomposed
3. **Implementation Guidelines**: Detailed patterns for error handling, typed mapping, and component design
4. **Sequence Diagrams**: Visual representation of complex multi-strategy and rebalancing workflows
5. **Code Navigation**: Direct links to all major components and their responsibilities
6. **Migration Roadmap**: Clear status of completed and ongoing architectural improvements

### Legacy Strategy Migration Documentation

This documentation update provides:

1. **Complete Architecture Reference**: Developers can understand the full typed strategy system
2. **Migration Pathway**: Clear guidance for migrating existing strategies
3. **Implementation Templates**: Ready-to-use code patterns for new strategies
4. **Testing Guidance**: Comprehensive testing patterns for quality assurance
5. **Rollout Strategy**: Safe deployment process using feature flags

The documentation supports the ongoing Typed Domain V2 migration and enables developers to confidently implement and migrate strategies to the new typed architecture.

Both documentation sets complement each other, providing a complete picture of the system's evolution from legacy to modern DDD architecture with comprehensive strategy and trading engine decomposition.
