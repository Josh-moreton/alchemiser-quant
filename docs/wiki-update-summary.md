# Wiki Documentation Update Summary

This document summarizes the wiki documentation updates for the Typed Strategy migration (Issue #122).

## Files Updated/Created

### 1. architecture/Strategies.md (Updated - 273 lines)
- **Before**: Basic 15-line overview of strategies
- **After**: Comprehensive typed strategy architecture documentation including:
  - Overview of multi-strategy trading system
  - Detailed typed architecture components (StrategyEngine, TypedStrategyManager, MarketDataPort)
  - StrategySignal value object documentation
  - Data flow diagrams and patterns
  - Strategy implementation templates with concrete examples
  - Error handling patterns
  - Feature flag integration details
  - Testing patterns and examples
  - Architecture benefits and design principles

### 2. guides/Typed-Strategy-Migration.md (Created - 498 lines)
- Comprehensive step-by-step migration guide covering:
  - Before/after comparison of legacy vs typed approaches
  - 5-step migration process with concrete examples
  - Complete typed strategy implementation template
  - Strategy registration updates
  - Unit and integration testing patterns
  - Data access migration from direct clients to protocols
  - Signal structure migration from dictionaries to domain objects
  - Error handling migration to structured reporting
  - Feature flag rollout strategy (3 phases)
  - Common migration issues and solutions
  - Validation checklist for completed migrations

### 3. reference/Feature-Flags.md (Updated - 162 lines)
- **Before**: Basic TYPES_V2_ENABLED information
- **After**: Detailed feature flag documentation including:
  - Configuration options and default behavior
  - Comprehensive effects across all system layers
  - Complete migration status for all components
  - 3-phase rollout process (development, staging, production)
  - Testing patterns for flag-controlled behavior
  - Monitoring and observability guidelines
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Key Content Highlights

### Technical Examples
- Complete `MyTypedStrategy` implementation template
- Protocol-based dependency injection patterns
- Typed signal generation with proper value objects
- Error handling using `TradingSystemErrorHandler`
- Unit testing with mocked `MarketDataPort`
- Integration testing with `TypedStrategyManager`

### Migration Patterns
- Legacy dictionary-based signals → Typed `StrategySignal` objects
- Direct client dependencies → Protocol-based `MarketDataPort`
- Basic exception handling → Structured error reporting
- Untyped float/int values → `Decimal`-based value objects

### Documentation Structure
- Clear hierarchical organization with cross-references
- Practical examples for every concept
- Step-by-step instructions with validation
- Troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Reference links between related documents

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Wiki content created and committed locally (commit: 800d612)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met:
  - Pages under `architecture/Strategies.md` and `guides/` updated
  - Examples showing typed `StrategyEngine` usage included
  - Feature flag rollout process documented
- ⚠️ Wiki push requires authentication (handled separately)

## Impact

This documentation update provides:

1. **Complete Architecture Reference**: Developers can understand the full typed strategy system
2. **Migration Pathway**: Clear guidance for migrating existing strategies
3. **Implementation Templates**: Ready-to-use code patterns for new strategies
4. **Testing Guidance**: Comprehensive testing patterns for quality assurance
5. **Rollout Strategy**: Safe deployment process using feature flags

The documentation supports the ongoing Typed Domain V2 migration and enables developers to confidently implement and migrate strategies to the new typed architecture.
