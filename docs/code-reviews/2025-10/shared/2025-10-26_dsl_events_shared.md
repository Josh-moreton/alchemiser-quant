**Date**: 2025-10-09

**Business function / Module**: shared (Event Schemas)

**Runtime context**: Pure data schema definitions (no runtime execution), used across all modules for DSL strategy evaluation events

**Criticality**: P1 (High) - Core event contracts for DSL strategy evaluation workflow, changes impact all consumers

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None found ✅

### High
1. **Missing `Literal` type for `branch_taken`**: `DecisionEvaluated.branch_taken` is typed as `str` but should be `Literal["then", "else"]` to prevent invalid values
2. **Missing `Literal` type for `allocation_type`**: `PortfolioAllocationProduced.allocation_type` is typed as `str` but should use `Literal` to constrain valid values

### Medium
3. **Inconsistent metadata field patterns**: Some events use `<event>_metadata` (e.g., `decision_metadata`) while BaseEvent has `metadata`; could cause confusion
4. **No validation on `n_selected` relationship**: `TopNSelected.n_selected` doesn't enforce relationship with `len(selected_symbols)`
5. **Missing constraint on `computation_time_ms`**: Field has `ge=0` constraint but no upper bound; could accept unrealistic values

### Low
6. **Module docstring could be more precise**: Lists event types but doesn't explain workflow order or event relationships
7. **No examples in docstrings**: Event classes lack usage examples which would help consumers
8. **Field descriptions could be more detailed**: Some fields like `parameters` in `StrategyEvaluationRequested` lack guidance on expected structure

### Info/Nits
9. **Empty line after imports**: Line 29 has comment "# Constants" but no constants are defined
10. **Consistent field ordering**: Events maintain consistent pattern (event_type, schema_version, then specific fields) ✅
11. **All events properly inherit from BaseEvent** ✅
12. **Type hints are complete and precise** ✅

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Single responsibility: DSL event schema definitions only
  
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ✅ All event classes have docstrings
  - ⚠️ Could add usage examples to each event class
  
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ All fields have type hints
  - ⚠️ Missing `Literal` for `branch_taken` and `allocation_type`
  - ✅ `Any` only used appropriately in metadata/parameters dicts
  
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - ✅ All events inherit from BaseEvent with `frozen=True` config
  - ✅ Field constraints applied where appropriate (min_length, ge)
  - ⚠️ Could add more specific constraints (Literal types, upper bounds)
  
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ✅ N/A - No financial calculations in schema definitions
  - ✅ `computation_time_ms` is float for measurement, appropriate
  
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ✅ N/A - Pure data schemas, no error handling needed
  - ✅ Pydantic will raise ValidationError on invalid data
  
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✅ Events inherit `event_id` from BaseEvent for deduplication
  - ✅ Schema definitions themselves are pure and idempotent
  
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ N/A - Pure schema definitions, no non-determinism
  
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No secrets present
  - ✅ Input validation via Pydantic constraints
  - ✅ No dynamic code execution
  
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ✅ All events inherit `correlation_id` and `causation_id` from BaseEvent
  - ✅ Schema supports traceability requirements
  
- [ ] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ⚠️ No dedicated test file for `dsl_events.py` found
  - ✅ Events tested indirectly through `test_events.py` (strategy_v2/engines/dsl)
  - ❌ Should add direct schema validation tests
  
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ N/A - Pure schema definitions, no performance concerns
  
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ N/A - No functions, only data classes
  - ✅ Each event class is simple and well-structured
  
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ 220 lines - well within limits
  
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ All imports are explicit
  - ✅ Correct import ordering: stdlib → pydantic → internal

### Contract Violations & Risks

1. **`branch_taken` field is untyped string**: While documented as "then/else", nothing prevents invalid values like "maybe" or empty string. This violates type safety principles.

2. **`allocation_type` field is untyped string**: Description says "final, intermediate" but no enforcement. Could accept any string.

3. **`n_selected` doesn't validate against `selected_symbols`**: Could have inconsistency like `n_selected=5` but `len(selected_symbols)=3`.

4. **`as_of_date` is string without format validation**: Could accept invalid date formats, should either use `datetime` or constrain format.

5. **No upper bound on `computation_time_ms`**: Could accept absurd values like 1e100 milliseconds.

## 5) Additional Notes

### Strengths

1. ✅ **Clear Structure**: All events follow consistent pattern (event_type, schema_version, specific fields, metadata)
2. ✅ **Proper Inheritance**: All events correctly inherit from BaseEvent
3. ✅ **Versioning**: All events include `schema_version` for backward compatibility
4. ✅ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout
5. ✅ **Immutability**: All events frozen via BaseEvent config
6. ✅ **Traceability**: All events inherit correlation/causation IDs from BaseEvent
7. ✅ **Documentation**: Each event has clear docstring explaining purpose
8. ✅ **Constraints**: Appropriate use of min_length, ge constraints where needed
9. ✅ **Module Size**: Compact and focused at 220 lines
10. ✅ **No Circular Imports**: Clean dependency graph

### Weaknesses

1. ⚠️ **Missing Tests**: No dedicated test file for schema validation
2. ⚠️ **Missing Literal Types**: Some string fields should use Literal for type safety
3. ⚠️ **No Cross-Field Validation**: No Pydantic validators for field relationships
4. ⚠️ **Minimal Examples**: Docstrings lack usage examples
5. ⚠️ **Generic Metadata Dicts**: Could be more structured for better type safety

### Recommendations

#### Priority 1: Add Literal Types for Constrained Strings

**Location**: Lines 212 (DecisionEvaluated.branch_taken) and 128-130 (PortfolioAllocationProduced.allocation_type)

**Rationale**: String fields with known valid values should use Literal to prevent invalid data at compile time and provide better IDE support.

**Implementation**:
```python
from typing import Any, Literal

class DecisionEvaluated(BaseEvent):
    # ...
    branch_taken: Literal["then", "else"] = Field(
        ..., description="Branch taken (then/else)"
    )

class PortfolioAllocationProduced(BaseEvent):
    # ...
    allocation_type: Literal["final", "intermediate"] = Field(
        ..., description="Type of allocation"
    )
```

#### Priority 2: Add Cross-Field Validators

**Location**: TopNSelected class (lines 166-195)

**Rationale**: Ensure `n_selected` matches `len(selected_symbols)` to prevent data inconsistencies.

**Implementation**:
```python
from pydantic import field_validator

class TopNSelected(BaseEvent):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    @field_validator('n_selected')
    @classmethod
    def validate_n_selected(cls, v: int, info) -> int:
        """Validate n_selected matches length of selected_symbols."""
        if 'selected_symbols' in info.data:
            selected = info.data['selected_symbols']
            if v != len(selected):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"n_selected ({v}) must match length of selected_symbols ({len(selected)})"
                )
        return v
```

#### Priority 3: Add Schema Validation Tests

**Location**: Create `tests/shared/events/test_dsl_events.py`

**Rationale**: Direct schema validation tests ensure events work correctly in isolation and catch validation issues early.

**Implementation**:
```python
import pytest
from datetime import datetime, UTC
from the_alchemiser.shared.events.dsl_events import (
    DecisionEvaluated,
    IndicatorComputed,
    # ... other events
)

@pytest.mark.unit
class TestDslEvents:
    """Test DSL event schema validation."""
    
    def test_decision_evaluated_valid_branch(self):
        """Test DecisionEvaluated accepts valid branch values."""
        # Test implementation
    
    def test_decision_evaluated_invalid_branch_fails(self):
        """Test DecisionEvaluated rejects invalid branch values."""
        # Test implementation
    
    # ... more tests
```

#### Priority 4: Add Upper Bounds on Time Metrics

**Location**: Line 103 (IndicatorComputed.computation_time_ms)

**Rationale**: Prevent unrealistic values that could indicate bugs or data corruption.

**Implementation**:
```python
computation_time_ms: float = Field(
    ge=0, 
    le=300000,  # 5 minutes max
    description="Computation time in milliseconds"
)
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Lines of Code | 220 | ≤ 500 | ✅ |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | N/A (schemas) | ≤ 10 | ✅ |
| Number of Event Classes | 7 | - | ✅ |
| Fields per Event | 5-9 | - | ✅ |
| Type Safety | ~95% | 100% | ⚠️ (missing Literal types) |
| Frozen/Immutable | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
| Schema Versioning | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
| Test Coverage | Indirect | Direct | ❌ (needs dedicated tests) |
| Import Order | Correct | Correct | ✅ |
| Docstring Coverage | 100% | 100% | ✅ |

### Conclusion

The file is **well-structured** and follows most best practices for Pydantic schema definitions. It serves its purpose as a centralized event schema repository for DSL evaluation events. However, to meet **institution-grade standards**, it needs improvements in:

1. **Type safety** (add Literal types for constrained strings) - HIGH PRIORITY
2. **Validation** (add cross-field validators) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. **Testing** (add dedicated schema validation tests) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. **Constraints** (add upper bounds on time metrics) - LOW PRIORITY

**Overall Assessment**: The schemas are production-ready but would benefit from the recommended improvements to prevent edge cases and provide better developer experience.

**Risk Level**: Low - The schemas work correctly and are used successfully in production. Recommended improvements are enhancements rather than critical fixes.
