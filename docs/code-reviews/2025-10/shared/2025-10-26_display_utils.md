## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] ✅ **The file has a clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - **Status**: PASS - Single purpose: prevent usage of deprecated module with clear error
  - **Evidence**: Module does nothing except raise RuntimeError with migration guidance
  
- [x] ✅ **Public functions/classes have docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - **Status**: N/A - No functions/classes defined
  - **Note**: Module docstring explains the deprecation and expected behavior
  
- [x] ✅ **Type hints are complete and precise** (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - **Status**: N/A - No functions/classes to type hint
  
- [x] ✅ **DTOs are frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - **Status**: N/A - No DTOs defined
  
- [x] ✅ **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - **Status**: N/A - No numerical operations
  
- [x] ✅ **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - **Status**: PASS - Uses built-in `RuntimeError` (appropriate for import-time guard)
  - **Evidence**: RuntimeError is intentional, not a bug to catch
  - **Note**: Does not use `shared.errors` because this is an import-time guard, not business logic
  
- [x] ✅ **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - **Status**: N/A - No handlers or side-effects beyond RuntimeError
  - **Note**: RuntimeError is deterministic and idempotent (always raises same error)
  
- [x] ✅ **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - **Status**: PASS - Behavior is 100% deterministic
  - **Evidence**: Always raises same RuntimeError with same message
  
- [x] ✅ **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - **Status**: PASS - No security risks
  - **Evidence**: No imports, no secrets, no dynamic code, no I/O
  
- [x] ✅ **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - **Status**: N/A - No logging (module raises before any logging could occur)
  - **Note**: RuntimeError message provides sufficient observability for accidental imports
  
- [x] ✅ **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - **Status**: PASS - 2/2 tests passing (100% coverage)
  - **Evidence**: 
    - `test_display_utils_raises_runtime_error_on_import` - Verifies RuntimeError raised
    - `test_display_utils_error_message_content` - Verifies error message content
  
- [x] ✅ **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - **Status**: PASS - Fails fast at import time, no I/O
  - **Evidence**: Module raises immediately, no expensive operations
  
- [x] ✅ **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - **Status**: PASS - Zero complexity (no branching, no functions)
  - **Evidence**: 13 lines total, no functions, no control flow
  
- [x] ✅ **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - **Status**: PASS - 13 lines (far below limits)
  - **Evidence**: Minimal module by design
  
- [x] ✅ **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - **Status**: PASS - No imports at all (correct for fail-fast guard)
  - **Evidence**: Lines 1-13 contain no import statements

## 5) Additional Notes

### Architectural Compliance

✅ **Deprecation Pattern**: This file implements a **proper deprecation pattern** that:
- Prevents accidental usage of removed functionality
- Provides clear, actionable error messages
- Fails fast at import time (no runtime surprises)
- Maintains backward compatibility check (code that imports this will immediately know it needs updating)

✅ **Migration Safety**: The RuntimeError approach ensures that:
- Old code paths are detected immediately during development/testing
- Error message guides developers to the correct alternative (event-driven logging)
- No silent failures or unexpected behavior

✅ **Module Boundaries**: Correctly placed in `orchestration` module as a deprecated placeholder for orchestration-related functionality

### Design Patterns

✅ **Guard Pattern**: Module implements a guard pattern that prevents usage at the earliest possible point (import time)

✅ **Fail-Fast Principle**: Raises exception immediately rather than allowing code to proceed with missing functionality

### Testing Coverage

✅ **Test Coverage**: 2/2 tests passing (100% coverage)
- Test 1: Verifies RuntimeError is raised on import
- Test 2: Verifies error message contains expected guidance

### Security Considerations

✅ **No Attack Surface**: Module has zero attack surface:
- No imports (can't be used to trigger malicious imports)
- No I/O operations
- No parsing of external data
- No dynamic code execution

### Observability

✅ **Clear Error Messages**: The RuntimeError message is:
- Descriptive (states what happened and why)
- Actionable (tells developer what to use instead)
- Specific (includes full module path for debugging)

### Maintainability

✅ **Self-Documenting**: Module name, docstring, and error message all clearly indicate deprecation status

✅ **Low Maintenance**: As a tombstone module, this requires no updates unless the migration guidance needs to change

✅ **Clear Intent**: Code is so simple that intent is immediately obvious to any reader

### Comparison to Best Practices

✅ **Matches Institution Standards**: This file follows the deprecation pattern used in professional Python packages:
- Python stdlib uses similar patterns for deprecated modules (e.g., `imp` module in Python 3.4+)
- Clear error messages with migration paths
- Fail-fast behavior prevents subtle bugs

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Why RuntimeError instead of DeprecationWarning?**
- ✅ RuntimeError is correct here because the functionality is **completely removed**, not just deprecated
- DeprecationWarning would suggest the module still works but will be removed in future
- RuntimeError immediately prevents any usage, which is the intended behavior

**Why module-level raise instead of function-level?**
- ✅ Module-level raise is correct because no functionality should be accessible
- Prevents partial imports or conditional usage
- Clearer signal that entire module is deprecated

6. ✅ **Maintainability**: Minimal code with clear intent
7. ✅ **Compliance**: Passes all linting, type checking, and testing requirements

### Minor Improvements (Optional)

While the file is functionally perfect, these minor improvements would enhance consistency:

1. **Business Unit Header**: Add standard header for consistency with other modules:
   ```python
   """Business Unit: orchestration | Status: deprecated
   
   Deprecated module placeholder.
   ```

2. **Explicit Deprecation in Error**: Consider adding deprecation version/date in error message (if applicable):
   ```python
   "the_alchemiser.orchestration.display_utils has been removed (deprecated v2.15.0). "
   ```

**Recommendation**: ✅ **APPROVED - OPTIONAL MINOR IMPROVEMENTS**

This file successfully prevents accidental usage of removed CLI display utilities while guiding developers to the event-driven logging alternative. It serves as a model example of how to deprecate functionality safely and clearly.

The file fulfills its purpose as a migration safety mechanism during the event-driven architecture transition, and the tests ensure this behavior is maintained.
