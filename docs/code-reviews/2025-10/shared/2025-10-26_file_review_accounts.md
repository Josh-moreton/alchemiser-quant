## 0) Metadata

**File path**: `the_alchemiser/shared/schemas/accounts.py`

**Commit SHA / Tag**: `095727c` (current HEAD on copilot/file-review-accounts-schema branch)

**Reviewer(s)**: GitHub Copilot AI Agent

**Date**: 2025-10-09

**Business function / Module**: shared/schemas

**Runtime context**: DTO definitions (in-memory data transfer objects, no I/O)

**Criticality**: P2 (Medium) - Core account data structures used by portfolio and execution modules

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```python
Internal: the_alchemiser.shared.schemas.base (Result)
External: pydantic (BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field), decimal (Decimal), typing (Any, Literal)
```

**External services touched**: None (pure data models)

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Produced: AccountSummary, AccountMetrics, BuyingPowerResult, RiskMetrics, RiskMetricsResult, 
          TradeEligibilityResult, PortfolioAllocationResult, EnrichedAccountSummaryView
Consumed: Result base class
```

**Related docs/specs**:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Core guardrails (Decimal for money, frozen DTOs, strict typing)
- `the_alchemiser/shared/schemas/base.py` - Result base class definition
- Alpaca API documentation (account data structures)
- `tests/shared/schemas/test_accounts.py` - Comprehensive unit and property-based tests

---

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

---

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None

### High
None - All previously identified high-severity issues have been addressed ✅

### Medium
1. **Missing correlation tracking fields** - Unlike event schemas (portfolio_state.py, execution schemas), no `correlation_id`/`causation_id` for traceability in service contexts
2. **No serialization helpers** - Unlike `execution_report.py`, missing `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` methods for complex serialization scenarios
3. **dict[str, Any] in EnrichedAccountSummaryView.raw** - The `raw` field uses untyped dict, though documented as intentional for preserving broker response structure
4. **dict[str, Any] in PortfolioAllocationResult.allocation_data** - Documented as intentional for flexibility, but specific allocation structures could benefit from typed models
5. **dict[str, Any] in TradeEligibilityResult.details** - Additional validation details use untyped dict

### Low
6. **Backward compatibility aliases without deprecation warnings** - Lines 358-364, no timeline for removal or runtime warnings
7. **leverage_ratio None case documentation** - Line 72-76, docstring mentions it but could be more explicit about cash account scenario
8. **Linting issue: __all__ not sorted** - RUF022 warning (cosmetic, can be auto-fixed with --unsafe-fixes)
9. **Missing blank lines after docstring sections** - D413 warnings in docstrings (cosmetic, auto-fixed)

### Info/Nits - Strengths of Current Implementation
10. **Excellent use of ConfigDict** - Consistent strict=True, frozen=True, validate_assignment=True across all models ✅
11. **Proper use of Decimal for financial values** - Follows guardrails correctly ✅
12. **Single responsibility maintained** - File only contains account-related DTOs ✅
13. **Comprehensive field validation** - Proper use of Field() with constraints (ge, le, min_length, max_length) ✅
14. **Schema versioning added** - All DTOs have schema_version field for backward compatibility ✅
15. **Type safety improved** - side field uses Literal["BUY", "SELL"], quantity uses Decimal ✅
16. **Comprehensive test coverage** - 34 passing tests including property-based tests with Hypothesis ✅
17. **Enhanced docstrings** - All classes have detailed Attributes sections and Examples ✅
18. **__all__ export list present** - Clear API surface with explicit exports ✅
19. **RiskMetrics is typed model** - Not dict[str, Any] anymore ✅
20. **Module header correct** - Now says "shared" per conventions ✅

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP) - Account DTOs only ✅
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes - Comprehensive Attributes and Examples ✅
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful) - Present, dict[str, Any] used only where intentional ✅
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types) - Frozen with comprehensive Field constraints ✅
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats - Proper Decimal usage throughout ✅
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught - N/A for DTOs, Pydantic ValidationError raised ✅
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks - N/A (pure DTOs) ✅
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic - N/A (pure data models) ✅
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports - Safe with comprehensive validation ✅
- [~] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops - Missing correlation fields for traceability ⚠️
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio) - 34 passing tests with Hypothesis ✅
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits - N/A (pure DTOs) ✅
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5 - Simple DTOs, no complex logic ✅
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800 - Only 365 lines ✅
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports - Clean import structure ✅

**Overall Score**: 14/15 (93%) - Excellent structure, only missing correlation tracking for service contexts

## 5) Additional Notes

### Strengths

**✅ Exceptional adherence to coding standards:**
- Excellent use of Pydantic v2 with strict=True, frozen=True, validate_assignment=True
- Proper use of Decimal for all financial values (follows guardrails)
- Clean module structure with single responsibility
- Consistent ConfigDict across all models
- Good separation of concerns (extends Result for success/error patterns)
- No float usage for money (follows guardrails)
- Immutability enforced via frozen=True

**✅ Comprehensive validation:**
- All financial fields have non-negative constraints (ge=0)
- Ratio fields properly constrained to 0-1 range (ge=0, le=1)
- String fields have length constraints (min_length, max_length)
- Quantity fields use Decimal with positive constraints (gt=0)
- Symbol fields have length limits (1-10 characters)

**✅ Type safety improvements:**
- RiskMetrics is now a typed model (previously dict[str, Any])
- side field uses Literal["BUY", "SELL"] for type safety
- quantity field uses Decimal (previously int)
- All DTOs have schema_version for backward compatibility

**✅ Comprehensive testing:**
- 34 passing unit tests covering all DTOs
- Property-based tests using Hypothesis for random value generation
- Validation tests for constraints (negative values, bounds, empty strings)
- Immutability tests (frozen=True enforcement)
- Type validation tests (Decimal not float, proper types)

### Architecture Alignment

- ✅ Located in correct module (shared/schemas)
- ✅ No dependencies on business modules
- ✅ Properly exported via shared/schemas/__init__.py
- ✅ Extends base Result class appropriately
- ⚠️ Missing correlation_id pattern from event-driven architecture (consider for service contexts)
- ✅ schema_version pattern implemented for backward compatibility

### Risk Assessment

- **Very low immediate risk** - Current implementation is production-ready
- **Low future risk** - Comprehensive validation prevents invalid data
- **Low maintainability risk** - Well-structured, documented code
- **Low testability risk** - Comprehensive test coverage with property-based tests

### Comparison with Similar Files

## 6) Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### Immediate (None Required for Production)

The file is production-ready. All critical and high-priority issues from previous reviews have been addressed.

### High Priority (Consider for Next Minor Version)

1. **Add correlation tracking fields** (for service method results, not all DTOs):
   ```python
   # Only for service-level DTOs that participate in event-driven workflows
   correlation_id: str | None = Field(None, description="Request correlation ID for traceability")
   causation_id: str | None = Field(None, description="Causation ID for event tracking")
   ```
   
2. **Add serialization helpers** (if complex scenarios arise):
   ```python
   def to_dict(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
       """Convert to dictionary with properly serialized Decimal values."""
       data = self.model_dump()
       # Decimal values are already JSON-serializable via Pydantic
       return data
   ```

3. **Consider typed models for remaining dict[str, Any] fields**:
   - `TradeEligibilityResult.details` - Could define ValidationDetailsModel
   - `PortfolioAllocationResult.allocation_data` - Could define AllocationBreakdownModel
   - However, current design with dict[str, Any] is documented as intentional for flexibility

### Medium Priority (Future Enhancement)

4. **Add deprecation warnings** for backward compatibility aliases:
   ```python
   import warnings
   
   def __getattr__(name: str) -> type:
       deprecated_names = {
           "AccountSummaryDTO": (AccountSummary, "3.0.0"),
           "AccountMetricsDTO": (AccountMetrics, "3.0.0"),
           # ... other aliases
       }
       
       if name in deprecated_names:
           cls, version = deprecated_names[name]
           warnings.warn(
               f"{name} is deprecated, use {cls.__name__} instead. "
               f"Will be removed in v{version}",
               DeprecationWarning,
               stacklevel=2
           )
           return cls
       raise AttributeError(f"module {__name__!r} has no attribute {name!r}")
   ```

5. **Fix cosmetic linting issues**:
   ```bash
   # Auto-fix the __all__ sorting issue
   poetry run ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes the_alchemiser/shared/schemas/accounts.py
   ```

6. **Enhance leverage_ratio documentation**:
   ```python
   leverage_ratio: Decimal | None = Field(
       None,
       ge=0,
       description="Leverage ratio (None for cash accounts or when margin not applicable)",
   )
   ```

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Add explicit version deprecation timeline** in comment:
   ```python
   # Backward compatibility aliases - will be removed in v3.0.0
   ```

8. **Consider TypedDict for EnrichedAccountSummaryView.raw** (only if broker response structure becomes stable):
   ```python
   from typing import TypedDict
   
   class BrokerAccountResponse(TypedDict, total=False):
       account_number: str
       equity: str  # Raw string from broker
       cash: str
       # ... other fields
   
   raw: BrokerAccountResponse = Field(..., description="Raw broker API response")
   ```
