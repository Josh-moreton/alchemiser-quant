## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical

**C1. Credentials stored as plain strings in memory (Lines 52-53)**
- API key and secret key stored as instance attributes without protection
- **Violation**: Security policy requires no secrets in memory without encryption
- **Impact**: Memory dumps, debugging sessions could expose credentials
- **Risk**: High - credentials could be logged or exposed in error messages

**C2. Broad exception handling swallows all errors (Lines 126-128, 145-146, 191-193, 202-203, 215-216)**
- Multiple `except Exception as e:` handlers catch all exceptions indiscriminately
- **Violation**: "exceptions are narrow, typed (from shared.errors), logged with context, and never silently caught"
- **Impact**: Masks critical errors like `KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`, `MemoryError`
- **Risk**: Critical - could hide systemic failures or make debugging impossible

**C3. Access to private SDK method `_run_forever()` (Line 308)**
- Directly calls `self._stream._run_forever()` which is a private method of Alpaca SDK
- **Violation**: Coupling to private API creates brittleness
- **Impact**: SDK updates could break functionality without warning
- **Risk**: High - production stability depends on undocumented API

### High

**H1. No typed exceptions from `shared.errors` (Entire file)**
- File catches `Exception` but never raises typed exceptions from `shared.errors.exceptions`
- Should use: `StreamingError`, `WebSocketError`, `DataProviderError`
- **Violation**: "exceptions are narrow, typed (from shared.errors)"
- **Impact**: Callers cannot handle specific error types appropriately

**H2. Missing correlation_id/causation_id in logging (All log statements)**
- No structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Violation**: "structured logging with correlation_id/causation_id"
- **Impact**: Cannot trace WebSocket connection issues through distributed system
- **Evidence**: Lines 94, 120, 123, 127, 143, 186, 240, 252, etc.

**H3. Thread safety issues with mutable state (Lines 58-61, 238)**
- Multiple threads can access/modify `_connected`, `_should_reconnect` without locks
- **Evidence**: `_connected` set in async methods (Line 238, 305, 326, 335) but read in sync method (Line 77)
- **Impact**: Race conditions between main thread and background thread
- **Risk**: Connection state could be inconsistent

**H4. Hard-coded delays and timeouts (Lines 107-117, 156, 169, 183, 357)**
- Magic numbers for delays: 5.0s, 0.05s, 0.5s, 1.0s, 10.0s, 30.0s
- **Violation**: "No hardcoding - use constants, config, or environment variables"
- **Impact**: Cannot tune for different environments; hard to test

**H5. Missing input validation (Lines 34-41)**
- `api_key` and `secret_key` not validated for non-empty strings
- `feed` parameter not validated against allowed values ("iex", "sip")
- **Violation**: "input validation at boundaries; fail-closed"
- **Impact**: Silent failures or confusing error messages

**H6. No idempotency protection (Methods: start, stop, restart)**
- Methods can be called multiple times with unclear behavior
- **Violation**: "handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded"
- **Evidence**: Line 93-95 warns but still returns True (ambiguous)

**H7. Resource leaks in error paths (Lines 139-146, 162-166)**
- Thread join timeout of 5s but no handling if thread doesn't terminate
- Stream may not be properly closed in all error scenarios
- **Impact**: Accumulating threads, socket connections, memory leaks

**H8. Callback invocation without error handling (Lines 298-300)**
- User-provided callbacks (`on_quote`, `on_trade`) called without try/except
- If callback raises exception, entire stream dies
- **Impact**: User code errors crash critical infrastructure

### Medium

**M1. Missing docstrings for private methods (Lines 242, 274, 314)**
- `_execute_stream_attempt`, `_setup_and_run_stream_with_symbols`, `_handle_no_symbols_to_subscribe` lack complete docstrings
- **Violation**: "Public functions/classes have docstrings with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes"
- Note: These are technically private but complex enough to warrant full docs

**M2. Incomplete docstrings (Lines 42-50, 72-75, 86-89)**
- Missing `Raises:` sections in docstrings
- Missing pre/post-conditions
- Missing failure mode descriptions

**M3. Non-deterministic behavior (Lines 115-117, 183-187)**
- Uses `time.sleep()` and `time.time()` for polling and delays
- **Violation**: "Determinism: tests freeze time (freezegun), seed RNG"
- **Impact**: Tests will be flaky; hard to verify timing-sensitive logic

**M4. Complexity hotspot: `start()` method (Lines 79-128, 50 lines)**
- Function has 50 lines, approaching limit of ≤50
- Mixes concerns: thread management, connection waiting, logging
- Cyclomatic complexity likely >10 due to nested conditionals and loops
- **Recommendation**: Extract connection waiting logic into separate method

**M5. Complexity hotspot: `restart()` method (Lines 148-193, 46 lines)**
- Function has 46 lines, close to limit
- Complex sequence: stop → wait → delay → restart → wait
- Multiple nested try/except blocks
- **Recommendation**: Extract waiting logic, consolidate error handling

**M6. Missing timeout parameters (Lines 34-50, 79-89)**
- No configurable timeouts for connection establishment
- No configurable max wait times
- Hard-coded in method bodies (violation of M4)

**M7. Circuit breaker not checked before attempts (Line 254)**
- Circuit breaker records success/failure but `can_attempt_connection()` never called
- **Impact**: Circuit breaker pattern incomplete; rate limiting not enforced
- **Evidence**: Should check before Line 254 in `_execute_stream_attempt`

**M8. Logger imported but typing not imported (Line 68)**
- `self.logger = get_logger(__name__)` but no type hint
- Should be: `self.logger: Logger = get_logger(__name__)`

**M9. Lazy import inside __init__ (Lines 63-66)**
- Circuit breaker imported inside `__init__` to avoid circular import
- **Code smell**: Suggests architectural issue
- **Recommendation**: Move import to module level or refactor dependencies

**M10. Polling loop wastes CPU (Lines 112-117, 338-340)**
- Active polling with sleep in tight loops
- **Impact**: Unnecessary CPU usage and energy consumption
- **Recommendation**: Use threading.Event or asyncio.Event for signaling

**M11. No structured exception context (Lines 127, 146, 192, 203, 216, 358)**
- Error logs use f-strings instead of structured fields
- **Violation**: "structured logging... no spam in hot loops"
- **Evidence**: `f"Error starting stream: {e}"` should be structured

**M12. Missing test coverage indication**
- No tests visible for this module in test directory
- **Violation**: "public APIs have tests... coverage ≥80%"
- Critical infrastructure component should have comprehensive tests

### Low

**L1. Type alias definition in TYPE_CHECKING block (Lines 20-28)**
- Type aliases defined differently based on TYPE_CHECKING
- While technically correct, could be clearer with TypeAlias annotation
- Consider: `AlpacaQuoteData: TypeAlias = dict[str, str | float | int] | Quote`

**L2. Boolean trap in return values (Lines 89, 121, 124)**
- `start()` returns `bool` but True can mean different things
- Line 95: already running → True
- Line 121: successfully started → True
- Ambiguous for caller

**L3. Inconsistent use of f-strings vs structured logging (Throughout)**
- Most logs use f-strings: `f"🔄 Attempting to start stream (attempt {attempt_number})"`
- Should use structured logging with fields: `logger.info("Attempting stream start", attempt=attempt_number)`

**L4. Emoji in production logs (Lines 94, 120, 123, 143, 240, 252, etc.)**
- May cause encoding issues in log aggregation systems
- Not all monitoring tools handle Unicode reliably
- Recommendation: Use standard ASCII or make emoji optional

**L5. Comment style inconsistency (Line 63)**
- Single-line comment: `# Circuit breaker for connection management`
- Should be docstring or removed (code is self-documenting with class name)

**L6. Daemon thread may cause abrupt termination (Line 102)**
- `daemon=True` means thread will be killed when main thread exits
- May not allow clean shutdown of WebSocket connection
- Consider: graceful shutdown mechanism

**L7. Parameter naming inconsistency (Line 81)**
- Parameter: `get_symbols_callback` 
- Stored as: `self._get_symbols`
- Name change reduces clarity

**L8. Missing return type documentation (Line 89)**
- Docstring says "Returns: True if started successfully"
- Doesn't document what False means (never returns False, only True)
- Line 124: returns False on timeout

**L9. Sleep durations not justified (Line 156)**
- `time.sleep(0.5)` - why 0.5 seconds specifically?
- Add comment explaining rationale for delays

**L10. Warning on line 165 but continues (Lines 164-166)**
- Logs warning if thread didn't terminate but doesn't handle the zombie thread
- Should track and report zombie threads

**L11. Exponential backoff formula exposed (Line 357)**
- `delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** (retry_count - 1)), 30.0)`
- Hard-coded formula; consider extracting to shared utility
- Max delay of 30.0 not configurable

**L12. Module header compliant (Lines 1-7)**
- ✅ Has required `"""Business Unit: shared | Status: current."""`
- ✅ Clear module purpose described

### Info/Nits

**I1. Type hint uses old union syntax (Lines 39-40, 58-60)**
- Uses `X | None` (Python 3.10+) which is correct
- ✅ Modern syntax, acceptable

**I2. Module size: 366 lines**
- Within acceptable range (target ≤500, split at >800)
- ✅ Compliant but monitor growth

**I3. Method complexity acceptable for most methods**
- Most methods under 50 lines
- `start()` at 50 lines (at limit)
- `restart()` at 46 lines (close to limit)

**I4. Good use of private methods (Lines 195+)**
- Internal implementation details properly prefixed with `_`
- Clear separation between public API and internal logic

**I5. Async/sync boundary handling (Lines 195-216)**
- Proper event loop creation for background thread
- Correct cleanup in finally block
- ✅ Good practice

**I6. Type checking guard (Lines 20-28)**
- Uses TYPE_CHECKING to avoid runtime import of Alpaca types
- ✅ Proper optimization for type checkers

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [⚠️] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Purpose: WebSocket stream lifecycle management

  - **Recommendation**: Consider extracting retry logic to separate component
  
- [❌] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ✅ All public methods have basic docstrings
  - ❌ Missing `Raises:` sections
  - ❌ Missing pre/post-conditions
  - ❌ Private methods lack complete documentation

- [⚠️] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ Most parameters have type hints
  - ❌ Logger lacks type hint (line 68)
  - ❌ `feed` parameter should be `Literal["iex", "sip"]`
  - ✅ No `Any` types found

- [N/A] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - N/A - This module doesn't define DTOs

- [N/A] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - N/A - No financial calculations in this module

- [❌] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ❌ **MAJOR VIOLATION**: 8 broad `except Exception` handlers
  - ❌ Never raises typed exceptions from `shared.errors`
  - ❌ Exceptions caught but not re-raised as typed errors
  - ❌ Should use: `StreamingError`, `WebSocketError`, `DataProviderError`

- [⚠️] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ⚠️ `start()` warns if already running but returns True (ambiguous)
  - ⚠️ `stop()` can be called multiple times (safe but not clearly documented)
  - ⚠️ `restart()` doesn't check if stream is actually running first
  - **Recommendation**: Make idempotency behavior explicit and consistent

- [❌] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ❌ Uses `time.time()` and `time.sleep()` extensively
  - ❌ Non-deterministic polling loops
  - ❌ Cannot reliably test timing behavior
  - **Recommendation**: Inject clock/timer for testability

- [❌] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ❌ **CRITICAL**: API key and secret stored as plain strings
  - ❌ No input validation on api_key, secret_key, feed
  - ⚠️ Credentials passed to external SDK function (line 290-293)
  - ✅ No eval/exec usage
  - ✅ Only one lazy import (circuit_breaker)

- [❌] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ❌ **MAJOR VIOLATION**: No correlation_id or causation_id anywhere
  - ❌ All logs use f-strings instead of structured fields
  - ✅ Appropriate log levels (info, error, warning)
  - ✅ Logs state transitions (connected, disconnected, retrying)
  - ⚠️ Emoji in logs may cause encoding issues

- [❌] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ❌ **MAJOR VIOLATION**: No visible test file for this module
  - ❌ Critical infrastructure should have comprehensive tests
  - ❌ Thread-safety, retry logic, error handling all need tests

- [⚠️] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ No hidden I/O - all I/O is explicit (WebSocket connection)
  - ⚠️ Polling loops waste CPU cycles
  - ⚠️ Circuit breaker not fully utilized (can_attempt_connection not called)
  - N/A No Pandas usage
  - N/A No HTTP clients (uses WebSocket)

- [⚠️] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ⚠️ `start()` method: 50 lines (at limit)
  - ⚠️ `restart()` method: 46 lines (close to limit)
  - ⚠️ `__init__`: 6 parameters (exceeds limit of 5)
  - ⚠️ Likely cyclomatic complexity >10 in start/restart due to nested conditions
  - **Recommendation**: Refactor start() and restart() to extract helpers

- [✅] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ 366 lines - well within limits
  - ✅ Good size for single responsibility

- [✅] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ Clean import structure
  - ✅ Proper ordering: stdlib → internal
  - ✅ No wildcard imports

## 5) Additional Notes

### Architecture & Design Observations

1. **Single Responsibility**: The class has a clear purpose (WebSocket stream lifecycle), but mixes several concerns:
   - Thread management (creating, starting, joining threads)
   - Connection management (establishing, monitoring, closing connections)
   - Retry logic (exponential backoff, max retries)
   - Circuit breaker integration
   - **Recommendation**: Consider extracting retry logic and thread management to separate components

2. **Thread Safety**: The class manages state across multiple threads but lacks explicit synchronization:
   - `_connected` and `_should_reconnect` modified from both sync (main thread) and async (background thread) contexts
   - No `threading.Lock` or `asyncio.Lock` protecting shared state
   - **Risk**: Race conditions, inconsistent state
   - **Recommendation**: Add explicit thread synchronization or use thread-safe primitives (threading.Event)

3. **Error Handling Philosophy**: The current approach catches all exceptions to prevent crashes, but violates the project's error handling policy:
   - Broad `except Exception` handlers mask specific failures
   - No typed exceptions raised for callers to handle
   - Error context lost when exceptions are caught and logged
   - **Recommendation**: Define specific exceptions in `shared.errors` for streaming failures

4. **Circuit Breaker Integration**: The circuit breaker is instantiated but not fully utilized:
   - `record_success()` and `record_failure()` are called
   - BUT `can_attempt_connection()` is never checked before attempts
   - Pattern incomplete - defeats purpose of rate limiting
   - **Recommendation**: Check circuit breaker state before each connection attempt

5. **Credentials Management**: Storing credentials as plain strings is a security risk:
   - Should use secure credential wrapper or vault integration
   - Consider: redacting credentials from error messages and logs
   - Alpaca SDK may handle credentials securely, but our code doesn't
   - **Recommendation**: Implement credential wrapper with __repr__ redaction

6. **Testability Issues**: Multiple factors make this code hard to test:
   - Uses real `time.time()` and `time.sleep()` - cannot mock time easily
   - Creates actual threads - makes tests slow and flaky
   - Polls for state changes - tests must wait for real time to pass
   - No dependency injection for thread creation or sleep
   - **Recommendation**: Inject clock/timer abstraction, use events instead of polling

7. **Async/Sync Boundary**: The class manages the boundary well in some ways:
   - Creates new event loop for background thread correctly
   - Cleans up pending tasks in finally block
   - BUT: Doesn't handle all edge cases (zombie threads, partial cleanup)

8. **User Callback Safety**: User-provided callbacks are called directly without error protection:
   - If `on_quote` or `on_trade` raises exception, entire stream crashes
   - Should wrap callbacks in try/except
   - Should log callback errors without crashing stream
   - **Recommendation**: Add callback error handling with dead letter queue

### Positive Aspects

1. ✅ **Clear module header** with business unit and status
2. ✅ **Good separation** of public and private methods
3. ✅ **Proper event loop management** for async operations in thread
4. ✅ **Reasonable retry logic** with exponential backoff
5. ✅ **Good use of type hints** (mostly complete)
6. ✅ **Module size** well within limits (366 lines)
7. ✅ **Clean import structure** following guidelines
8. ✅ **Circuit breaker pattern** integrated (though not fully utilized)

### Security Concerns

1. 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Plain text credential storage (lines 52-53)
2. 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Credentials passed to external SDK without protection (line 290-293)
3. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: No input validation - invalid credentials accepted silently
4. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Symbol lists in logs may expose trading strategies (line 285-286)
5. 🟢 **LOW**: Daemon threads may not allow secure cleanup on shutdown

### Observability Gaps

1. ❌ No correlation_id or causation_id in any log statement
2. ❌ No structured logging - all logs use f-strings
3. ❌ Cannot trace a specific connection through its lifecycle
4. ❌ Cannot correlate WebSocket events with trading decisions
5. ⚠️ Emoji in logs may break some log aggregation systems
6. ⚠️ Error logs lack sufficient context for debugging

### Performance Considerations

1. ⚠️ CPU waste from polling loops (lines 112-117, 338-340)
2. ⚠️ Circuit breaker not checked = unnecessary connection attempts
3. ⚠️ No connection pooling or reuse strategy
4. ⚠️ Hard-coded delays may be suboptimal for different network conditions
5. ✅ Background thread doesn't block main thread
6. ✅ Async operations used appropriately for I/O

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (Critical/High):
1. 🔴 **Replace broad exception handlers** with typed exceptions from `shared.errors`
2. 🔴 **Implement credential protection** - use secure wrapper
3. 🔴 **Add thread synchronization** - use threading.Lock or Event
4. 🔴 **Check circuit breaker** before connection attempts
5. 🔴 **Wrap user callbacks** in error handlers
6. 🟡 **Add input validation** for api_key, secret_key, feed
7. 🟡 **Add structured logging** with correlation_id
8. 🟡 **Replace time.sleep() polling** with Event-based signaling

#### Short-term (Medium):
1. **Add comprehensive tests** - unit tests for all public methods
2. **Complete docstrings** - add Raises:, pre/post-conditions
3. **Extract configuration** - move hard-coded constants to config
4. **Refactor start() and restart()** - reduce complexity
5. **Add timeout parameters** - make timing configurable
6. **Handle zombie threads** - track and report/kill orphaned threads
7. **Use public SDK API** - replace `_run_forever()` with public method
8. **Inject timer abstraction** - for testability

#### Long-term (Low/Refactor):
1. **Extract retry logic** to separate component
2. **Extract thread management** to separate component
3. **Use connection pool** if multiple streams needed
4. **Add metrics** - connection duration, retry counts, error rates
5. **Add health checks** - expose connection status via API
6. **Consider async all the way** - make public API async instead of thread-based
7. **Remove emoji from logs** - use ASCII-only for compatibility

## 6) Recommendation

**Status: REQUIRES REMEDIATION (Critical + High severity issues identified)**

**Action items:**

### Must Fix (Before Production Use):
1. 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Replace all 8 `except Exception` handlers with narrow, typed exceptions
2. 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Implement secure credential storage (redaction in __repr__)
3. 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Replace private SDK method `_run_forever()` with public API
4. 🔴 **HIGH**: Add thread synchronization (Lock or Event) for shared state
5. 🔴 **HIGH**: Add structured logging with correlation_id throughout
6. 🔴 **HIGH**: Implement user callback error handling
7. 🔴 **HIGH**: Add input validation for api_key, secret_key, feed

### Should Fix (Before Next Release):
1. 🟡 **HIGH**: Check circuit breaker before connection attempts
2. 🟡 **HIGH**: Extract hard-coded timeouts/delays to configuration
3. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Replace polling loops with Event-based signaling
4. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Add comprehensive test suite
5. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Complete docstrings with Raises: sections
6. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Refactor start() and restart() methods (reduce complexity)

### Consider for Future:
1. 🟢 **MEDIUM**: Extract retry logic to reusable component
2. 🟢 **LOW**: Inject timer abstraction for testability
3. 🟢 **LOW**: Remove emoji from logs (ASCII-only)
4. 🟢 **LOW**: Add metrics and health checks

**Timeline:** Critical issues must be resolved before this component is used in live trading. High severity issues should be addressed in the next sprint. Medium/Low issues can be tracked as technical debt.

**Testing Requirements:** 
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Thread-safety tests with concurrent access
- Retry logic tests with time mocking
- Error handling tests for all exception paths
- Integration tests with mock Alpaca SDK

## 7) Dependencies & Imports Analysis

### Internal Dependencies
- ✅ `shared.brokers.alpaca_utils` - allowed cross-module import
- ✅ `shared.logging` - allowed shared utility import
- ⚠️ `shared.utils.circuit_breaker` - lazy import (line 64), suggests circular dependency risk

### External Dependencies
- ✅ All stdlib imports (asyncio, threading, time, typing, collections.abc)
- ✅ Third-party: alpaca-py (StockDataStream, Quote, Trade)
- ✅ No unexpected or risky external dependencies

### Import Violations
- ✅ No `import *` usage
- ✅ No deep relative imports
- ✅ Proper ordering: stdlib → third-party → internal
- ⚠️ Lazy import in __init__ is code smell (line 64)
