## 0) Metadata

**File path**: `the_alchemiser/shared/math/num.py`

**Commit SHA / Tag**: `802cf268358e3299fb6b80a4b7cf3d4bda2994f4`

**Reviewer(s)**: GitHub Copilot

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Business function / Module**: shared/math (utilities)

**Runtime context**: 
- Used for float comparison with tolerance in strategy calculations and mathematical utilities
- Lightweight utility module used in-memory across strategy and shared modules
- No direct external I/O or network calls
- Pure computation with optional numpy array support
- Called from `the_alchemiser.shared.math.math_utils` for statistical calculations

**Criticality**: P2 (Medium) - Used in mathematical calculations but simple utility with extensive tests

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```python
Internal: None
External: 
  - math.isclose (stdlib)
  - decimal.Decimal (stdlib)
  - collections.abc.Sequence (stdlib)
  - numpy (optional, gracefully degraded if not available)
```

**External services touched**: None - Pure utility module with no I/O

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Consumed by:
  - the_alchemiser.shared.math.math_utils.calculate_stdev_returns
  - tests.shared.math.test_num (34 test cases)
  
Produces: 
  - Boolean comparison results (floats_equal)
  - Numeric values extracted from sequences (_extract_numeric_value)
```

**Related docs/specs**:
- [Copilot Instructions](/.github/copilot-instructions.md) - Float comparison guardrails
- [Test Suite](/tests/shared/math/test_num.py) - 34 tests including property-based tests
- [Math Utils](/the_alchemiser/shared/math/math_utils.py) - Primary consumer

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

---

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None identified.

### High
None identified.

### Medium
1. **Incomplete docstring for floats_equal** - Missing pre-conditions, edge case documentation, and examples showing default tolerance behavior
2. **No explicit handling of NaN values** - While numpy uses `equal_nan=False`, scalar comparison via `math.isclose` may have different NaN handling
3. **Type alias not explicitly exported** - `Number` and `SequenceLike` are defined but not in `__all__` if consumers need them

### Low
1. **Private function _extract_numeric_value could be public** - May be useful for other modules but marked private
2. **No explicit __all__ export list** - Public API not explicitly declared
3. **Pragma comment on numpy import** - While reasonable, could document why numpy is optional more clearly
4. **Module header generic** - Says "utilities" but could be more specific "shared/math"
5. **Silent fallback in numpy comparison** - `except` block has pragma but doesn't log fallback behavior

### Info/Nits
1. **Test coverage is excellent** - 34 tests including property-based tests with Hypothesis
2. **Cyclomatic complexity is low** - Both functions have complexity of 5 (well within limit of 10)
3. **Type hints are comprehensive** - Good use of union types and type aliases
4. **Optional numpy dependency well-handled** - Graceful degradation pattern

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Single responsibility: Provide tolerant float comparison utilities
  - ✅ Does not mix concerns; pure mathematical utilities

- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ✅ Both functions have docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises
  - ⚠️ Could enhance with examples and edge case documentation (Medium)

- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ Comprehensive type hints using union types
  - ✅ No `Any` types used
  - ✅ Type aliases defined for complex types

- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated
  - ✅ N/A - Pure utility functions, no DTOs

- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ✅ PRIMARY PURPOSE: Provides `math.isclose` wrapper to enforce float comparison rules
  - ✅ Accepts Decimal inputs and converts to float for comparison
  - ⚠️ Decimal→float conversion may lose precision (documented as acceptable for non-financial contexts)
  - ✅ Default tolerances (rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-12) are reasonable

- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ✅ ValueError for empty sequences (clear message)
  - ✅ TypeError for unsupported types (includes type information)
  - ⚠️ Could use custom exceptions from `shared.errors` but stdlib exceptions acceptable for utilities
  - ⚠️ Silent except for numpy fallback (has pragma but no logging)

- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✅ Pure functions with no side effects
  - ✅ Naturally idempotent

- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ Fully deterministic functions
  - ✅ No randomness or time dependencies
  - ✅ Property-based tests with Hypothesis validate deterministic behavior

- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No security concerns
  - ✅ Input validation for empty sequences and unsupported types

- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ✅ N/A - Pure utility functions don't require logging
  - ℹ️ Silent fallback in numpy comparison could benefit from debug logging

- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ✅ EXCELLENT: 34 test cases including property-based tests
  - ✅ Tests cover: reflexivity, symmetry, tolerance bounds, edge cases
  - ✅ Both unit tests and property-based tests present
  - ✅ Tests validate numpy arrays, scalars, sequences, Decimal, int, float

- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ No I/O operations
  - ✅ Numpy vectorization used when available
  - ✅ Efficient fallback to scalar comparison

- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ `_extract_numeric_value`: complexity = 5 (15 lines)
  - ✅ `floats_equal`: complexity = 5 (30 lines)
  - ✅ Both functions have 4 parameters or fewer
  - ✅ Well within complexity limits

- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ 78 lines total - excellent
  - ✅ Focused and concise module

- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ No wildcard imports
  - ✅ Imports properly ordered: stdlib first, optional third-party handled gracefully
  - ✅ No local imports (this is a leaf utility module)

## 5) Additional Notes

### Strengths

1. ✅ **Enforces float comparison guardrail** - Primary purpose is to provide safe float comparison, preventing direct `==` usage
2. ✅ **Excellent test coverage** - 34 tests including property-based tests with Hypothesis
3. ✅ **Optional numpy support** - Graceful degradation when numpy unavailable
4. ✅ **Low complexity** - Both functions have cyclomatic complexity of 5
5. ✅ **Type safety** - Comprehensive type hints with union types
6. ✅ **Defensive programming** - Validates inputs, handles edge cases
7. ✅ **Pure functions** - No side effects, deterministic behavior

### Architecture Alignment

- ✅ Located in correct module (`shared/math`)
- ✅ No dependencies on business modules
- ✅ Pure utility module with no side effects
- ✅ Leaf module in dependency graph

### Usage Patterns

**Current consumers:**
1. `the_alchemiser.shared.math.math_utils` - Uses `floats_equal` for statistical calculations
2. Test suite - 34 comprehensive test cases

**Intended use case:**
- Non-financial float comparisons (strategy indicators, statistical calculations)
- NOT for money/currency comparisons (use Decimal value objects instead)

### Comparison with Similar Utilities

**Money** (`money.py`) and **Percentage** (`percentage.py`):
- Those use `Decimal` exclusively for financial precision
- This module explicitly uses `float` for non-financial contexts
- Clear separation of concerns maintained

### Risk Assessment

- **Low immediate risk** - Well-tested, simple utilities
- **Low future risk** - Focused API unlikely to need expansion
- **Low maintainability risk** - Simple, well-documented code
- **Low performance risk** - Efficient implementation with numpy optimization

### Precision Considerations

**Important limitation documented in module docstring:**
> "Use this helper in non-financial contexts; for money/quantities always prefer Decimal value objects."

This correctly scopes the module's use to contexts where float precision is acceptable:
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA)
- Statistical measures (mean, standard deviation)
- Ratio comparisons (Sharpe ratio, correlation)

**NOT appropriate for:**
- Money amounts
- Portfolio values
- Position quantities
- Order prices

## 6) Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### High Priority
None required - module is production-ready.

### Medium Priority (Quality Improvements)

1. **Enhance floats_equal docstring** - Add examples and edge case documentation:
   ```python
   """Check whether two floating-point values are approximately equal.
   
   Uses relative and absolute tolerances to determine equality. This function
   should be used for non-financial float comparisons. For money/quantities,
   always use Decimal value objects.
   
   Args:
       a: First value or array to compare.
       b: Second value or array to compare.
       rel_tol: Relative tolerance for comparison (default: 1e-9).
       abs_tol: Absolute tolerance for comparison (default: 1e-12).
   
   Returns:
       bool: True if the values are equal within the given tolerances.
   
   Examples:
       >>> floats_equal(1.0, 1.0)
       True
       >>> floats_equal(1.0, 1.0 + 1e-10)  # Within default tolerance
       True
       >>> floats_equal(1.0, 1.001)  # Outside default tolerance
       False
       >>> floats_equal(0.0, 1e-13)  # Near-zero comparison uses abs_tol
       True
   
   Note:
       - NaN values are never equal to each other or any other value
       - Infinity comparisons use standard float comparison rules
       - For numpy arrays, all elements must be within tolerance
       - Sequence inputs use first element only
   """
   ```

2. **Document default tolerance rationale** - Add comment explaining why 1e-9 and 1e-12:
   ```python
   # Default tolerances chosen to balance precision and practicality:
   # - rel_tol=1e-9: ~9 decimal places relative precision
   # - abs_tol=1e-12: ~12 decimal places absolute precision near zero
   # These match Python's math.isclose defaults for consistency
   ```

3. **Document Decimal precision loss** - Add note in docstring:
   ```python
   """
   ...
   Note:
       When comparing Decimal values, they are converted to float which may
       lose precision. This is acceptable for non-financial comparisons but
       means extremely precise Decimal values (>15 significant figures) may
       not compare accurately. For financial values, use Decimal directly.
   """
   ```

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

4. **Add explicit __all__** - Declare public API:
   ```python
   __all__ = ["floats_equal", "Number", "SequenceLike"]
   ```

5. **Consider debug logging for numpy fallback** - Help diagnose issues:
   ```python
   except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError) as e:
       logger.debug(f"Numpy comparison failed, falling back to scalar: {e}")
       pass
   ```

6. **Document sequence extraction assumption** - In _extract_numeric_value:
   ```python
   # Returns first element of sequence. Assumes sequences contain homogeneous
   # numeric values; only the first element is used for comparison.
   return value[0]
   ```

7. **Update module header** - Be more specific:
   ```python
   """Business Unit: shared/math; Status: current.
   ```
