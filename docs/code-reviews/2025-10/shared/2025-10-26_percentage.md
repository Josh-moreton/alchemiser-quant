## 0) Metadata

**File path**: `the_alchemiser/shared/types/percentage.py`

**Commit SHA / Tag**: `802cf268358e3299fb6b80a4b7cf3d4bda2994f4`

**Reviewer(s)**: Josh, Copilot

**Date**: 2025-10-05

**Business function / Module**: shared/types (utilities)

**Runtime context**: 
- Used in strategy signals for target_allocation representation
- Lightweight value object used in-memory across strategy, portfolio, and execution modules
- No direct external I/O or network calls
- Pure computation with validation on construction

**Criticality**: P2 (Medium) - Used in critical trading calculations but simple value object with extensive tests

**Direct dependencies (imports)**:
```python
Internal: 
  - the_alchemiser.shared.constants.PERCENTAGE_RANGE
  - the_alchemiser.shared.utils.validation_utils.validate_decimal_range
External: 
  - dataclasses (stdlib)
  - decimal.Decimal (stdlib)
```

**External services touched**: None - Pure value object with no I/O

**Interfaces (DTOs/events) produced/consumed**:
```
Consumed by:
  - StrategySignal.target_allocation (strategy_value_objects.py)
  - Tests in test_percentage.py
  
Produces: Percentage value objects (immutable, frozen dataclass)
```

**Related docs/specs**:
- [Copilot Instructions](/.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- [Percentage Test Suite](/tests/shared/types/test_percentage.py)
- [Money Value Object](/the_alchemiser/shared/types/money.py) - Similar pattern

## 1) Scope & Objectives

- Verify the file's **single responsibility** and alignment with intended business capability.
- Ensure **correctness**, **numerical integrity**, **deterministic behaviour** where required.
- Validate **error handling**, **idempotency**, **observability**, **security**, and **compliance** controls.
- Confirm **interfaces/contracts** (DTOs/events) are accurate, versioned, and tested.
- Identify **dead code**, **complexity hotspots**, and **performance risks**.

## 2) Summary of Findings (use severity labels)

### Critical
None identified.

### High
None identified.

### Medium
1. **Missing arithmetic operations** - Unlike Money value object, Percentage lacks common operations (addition, multiplication) that may be needed for portfolio calculations
2. **No __eq__ and __hash__ implementations** - While dataclass provides defaults, explicit implementations with Decimal comparison would be more robust
3. **Missing precision/rounding specification** - No explicit rounding mode or precision guarantees documented

### Low
1. **Incomplete docstrings** - Methods lack Args/Returns/Raises sections per institution standards
2. **No __repr__ override** - Default dataclass repr may be verbose; custom repr could improve debugging
3. **Missing range validation examples** - Docstring doesn't show valid/invalid examples
4. **No comparison operators** - Cannot directly compare percentages (e.g., p1 < p2) without accessing .value

### Info/Nits
1. **Module header business unit** - Says "utilities" but could be more specific "shared/types" or "value_objects"
2. **from_percent accepts float** - Could also accept Decimal or int for type flexibility (like StrategySignal does)
3. **No explicit __slots__** - Not needed for frozen dataclass but could save memory if heavily used
4. **Test coverage is excellent** - 281 lines of tests including property-based tests

## 4) Correctness & Contracts

### Correctness Checklist

- [x] The file has a **clear purpose** and does not mix unrelated concerns (SRP)
  - ✅ Single responsibility: Percentage value object representation
- [x] Public functions/classes have **docstrings** with inputs/outputs, pre/post-conditions, and failure modes
  - ⚠️ Partial: Main class has docstring but methods are minimal (Low severity)
- [x] **Type hints** are complete and precise (no `Any` in domain logic; use `Literal/NewType` where helpful)
  - ✅ All functions properly typed with Decimal
- [x] **DTOs** are **frozen/immutable** and validated (e.g., Pydantic v2 models with constrained types)
  - ✅ Frozen dataclass with validation in `__post_init__`
- [x] **Numerical correctness**: currency uses `Decimal`; floats use `math.isclose` or explicit tolerances; no `==`/`!=` on floats
  - ✅ Uses Decimal throughout; float only accepted as input to from_percent and converted via str()
  - ⚠️ No explicit equality tolerance documented (Medium severity)
- [x] **Error handling**: exceptions are narrow, typed (from `shared.errors`), logged with context, and never silently caught
  - ✅ Validation raises ValueError via validate_decimal_range
  - ℹ️ Could use custom exception from shared.errors but ValueError is acceptable for value objects
- [x] **Idempotency**: handlers tolerate replays; side-effects are guarded by idempotency keys or checks
  - ✅ Pure value object, no side effects, naturally idempotent
- [x] **Determinism**: tests freeze time (`freezegun`), seed RNG; no hidden randomness in business logic
  - ✅ Fully deterministic, tests include property-based tests
- [x] **Security**: no secrets in code/logs; input validation at boundaries; no `eval`/`exec`/dynamic imports
  - ✅ No security concerns in this value object
- [x] **Observability**: structured logging with `correlation_id`/`causation_id`; one log per state change; no spam in hot loops
  - ✅ N/A for value objects (no logging needed)
- [x] **Testing**: public APIs have tests; property-based tests for maths; coverage ≥ 80% (≥ 90% for strategy/portfolio)
  - ✅ Excellent: 281 lines of tests with property-based tests using Hypothesis
  - ✅ Tests cover: construction, validation, from_percent, to_percent, round-trips, properties
- [x] **Performance**: no hidden I/O in hot paths; vectorised Pandas ops; HTTP clients pooled with rate limits
  - ✅ Pure computation, no I/O, lightweight operations
- [x] **Complexity**: cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, functions ≤ 50 lines, params ≤ 5
  - ✅ All methods under 5 lines, cyclomatic complexity = 1-2 per method
- [x] **Module size**: ≤ 500 lines (soft), split if > 800
  - ✅ Only 37 lines - extremely focused
- [x] **Imports**: no `import *`; stdlib → third-party → local; no deep relative imports
  - ✅ Clean import structure, proper ordering

### Overall Correctness Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **PASS** - File is correct and production-ready

The file demonstrates excellent adherence to financial-grade standards:
- Immutable value object pattern correctly implemented
- Decimal precision throughout (no float arithmetic)
- Comprehensive validation on construction
- Extensive test coverage including property-based tests
- Minimal complexity and clear single responsibility

The identified issues are enhancements rather than defects. The file can safely remain as-is or be enhanced with the low/medium severity improvements.

## 5) Additional Notes

### Comparison with Similar Value Objects

**Money** (`money.py`):
- ✅ Has arithmetic operations (add, multiply)
- ✅ Has precision normalization in `__post_init__` (quantize to 0.01)
- ✅ Uses ROUND_HALF_UP explicitly
- ⚠️ Percentage lacks these features

**Quantity** (`quantity.py`):
- ✅ Similar pattern: frozen dataclass with validation
- ✅ Similar size: 23 lines vs Percentage's 37 lines
- ✅ Uses shared validation utility (validate_non_negative_integer)

### Usage Context

The Percentage class is used in:
1. **StrategySignal.target_allocation** - Represents portfolio allocation targets
2. **Tests** - Comprehensive test coverage validates all operations

Usage is currently limited, suggesting the minimal API is appropriate. If portfolio rebalancing logic needs percentage arithmetic (e.g., calculating allocation differences), enhancement would be warranted.

### Best Practices Observed

1. ✅ **Immutability** - `frozen=True` prevents accidental mutation
2. ✅ **Decimal precision** - All numeric operations use Decimal
3. ✅ **Validation on construction** - Invalid values cannot exist
4. ✅ **Safe float conversion** - Uses str() intermediate to avoid precision loss
5. ✅ **Shared validation** - Delegates to centralized validation_utils
6. ✅ **Comprehensive tests** - Including property-based tests

### Recommendations

#### Priority 1 (Optional - Low Impact)
1. Enhance docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises sections
2. Add usage examples to class docstring

#### Priority 2 (Optional - Medium Impact)
1. Consider arithmetic operations if needed for portfolio calculations:
   ```python
   def add(self, other: Percentage) -> Percentage:
       """Add two percentages (e.g., 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5)."""
       return Percentage(self.value + other.value)
   
   def multiply(self, factor: Decimal) -> Percentage:
       """Scale percentage by factor (e.g., 0.5 * 2 = 1.0)."""
       return Percentage(self.value * factor)
   ```

2. Add comparison operators for natural ordering:
   ```python
   def __lt__(self, other: Percentage) -> bool:
       return self.value < other.value
   ```

3. Document precision/rounding policy in docstring

#### Priority 3 (Optional - Nice to Have)
1. Accept multiple types in from_percent (Decimal, int, float)
2. Add from_decimal factory method for clarity
3. Custom __repr__ for cleaner debugging

**None of these recommendations are required.** The file is production-ready as-is.
