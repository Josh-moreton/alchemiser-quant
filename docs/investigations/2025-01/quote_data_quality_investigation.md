# Quote Data Quality Investigation

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Issue:** Investigate quote problems and lack of data provider redundancy  
**Status:** âœ… Resolved  

## Problem Statement

Recurring issues with quote data quality leading to order placement failures:
- Streaming quotes showed valid prices (bid=269.58, ask=270.73 for BULZ)
- Liquidity analysis produced negative recommended prices (-0.01, -0.02)
- Orders failed with "cost basis must be >= minimal amount of order 1"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The bug was in `the_alchemiser/execution_v2/utils/liquidity_analysis.py` in the `_calculate_volume_aware_prices` method:

```python
# Line 207: Aggressive pricing for heavy bid side
if imbalance < -0.2:
    recommended_bid = min(recommended_bid + self.tick_size, ask_price - self.tick_size)
```

**Problem:** If `ask_price` was corrupted or zero (due to upstream data quality issues), the expression `ask_price - self.tick_size` could produce negative values like `-0.01`.

**Similar issue on line 212 for ask side:**
```python
elif imbalance > 0.2:
    recommended_ask = max(recommended_ask - self.tick_size, bid_price + self.tick_size)
```

### Why This Occurred
1. No early validation of quote prices before arithmetic operations
2. Aggressive pricing logic assumed valid positive prices
3. Fallback validation at lines 223-235 caught negatives but used $0.01 minimum, causing order failures

### Data Flow Analysis
The corruption happened somewhere between:
1. Streaming quote reception (correct: bid=269.58, ask=270.73)
2. Liquidity analysis execution (incorrect: leading to -0.01, -0.02)

Possible causes:
- Stale quote data overwriting fresh data in concurrent environment
- Attribute access on wrong QuoteModel variant (legacy vs. market_data)
- Type coercion issues during Decimal/float conversions
- Race condition in quote storage/retrieval

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Early Validation (Line 182-193)
```python
# Early validation: Ensure quote prices are positive before any calculations
if quote.bid_price <= 0 or quote.ask_price <= 0:
    logger.error(
        f"Invalid quote prices for {quote.symbol}: "
        f"bid_price={quote.bid_price}, ask_price={quote.ask_price}. "
        f"Cannot calculate volume-aware prices with non-positive values."
    )
    # Return minimum valid prices as emergency fallback
    min_price = Decimal("0.01")
    return {"bid": float(min_price), "ask": float(min_price)}
```

### 2. Defensive Aggressive Pricing (Lines 236-258)
```python
# If heavy bid side (imbalance < -0.2), be more aggressive on buys
if imbalance < -0.2:
    # Ensure we don't create negative prices
    aggressive_bid_limit = ask_price - self.tick_size
    if aggressive_bid_limit > 0:
        recommended_bid = min(recommended_bid + self.tick_size, aggressive_bid_limit)
        logger.debug(f"Heavy bid side detected, adjusting buy price to {recommended_bid}")
    else:
        logger.warning(
            f"Cannot apply heavy bid side adjustment for {quote.symbol}: "
            f"ask_price ({ask_price}) too small for tick adjustment"
        )
```

### 3. Enhanced Diagnostic Logging (Lines 74-101)
```python
# Enhanced logging with full quote details for suspicious quotes
if quote.bid_price <= 0 or quote.ask_price <= 0 or quote.bid_price > quote.ask_price:
    logger.error(
        f"Suspicious quote detected for {quote.symbol}: "
        f"bid_price={quote.bid_price}, ask_price={quote.ask_price}, "
        f"bid_size={quote.bid_size}, ask_size={quote.ask_size}, "
        f"timestamp={quote.timestamp}"
    )
```

## Data Provider Redundancy

### Current Architecture âœ…
The system already implements robust data provider redundancy:

1. **Primary Source:** WebSocket streaming quotes
   - Real-time bid/ask updates
   - Low latency (~100ms)
   - Continuous market depth data

2. **Validation Layer:** REST API cross-check
   - Suspicious quote detection triggers REST validation
   - Compares streaming vs. REST mid-prices
   - Uses REST if difference > 10%

3. **Fallback Source:** REST API
   - Used when streaming unavailable
   - Reliable but higher latency (~200-500ms)
   - No real-time market depth

### Suspicious Quote Detection
`_is_streaming_quote_suspicious()` checks for:
- Negative prices
- Inverted spreads (ask < bid)
- Unreasonably low prices (< $0.01)
- Excessive spreads (> 10%)

### Validation Flow
```
Streaming Quote Received
         â†“
Is Suspicious? â†’ NO â†’ Use Streaming Quote
         â†“ YES
   Validate with REST
         â†“
  REST Quote Valid? â†’ YES â†’ Use REST Quote
         â†“ NO
Use Streaming Quote (with warning)
```

## Test Coverage

Added comprehensive tests in `tests/execution_v2/test_liquidity_analysis.py`:

1. **test_prevents_negative_prices_with_zero_quote_prices**
   - Validates handling of zero prices
   - Ensures minimum $0.01 fallback

2. **test_prevents_negative_prices_with_negative_quote_prices**
   - Validates handling of negative prices
   - Prevents propagation of invalid data

3. **test_normal_quotes_produce_positive_recommended_prices**
   - Regression test with actual BULZ quote
   - Validates normal operation produces sensible prices

4. **test_aggressive_pricing_doesnt_produce_negative_values**
   - Tests heavy imbalance scenarios
   - Validates aggressive adjustments remain positive

5. **test_small_price_stocks_handled_safely**
   - Tests low-priced stocks ($0.50-$0.52)
   - Ensures tick adjustments don't go negative

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. âœ… Deploy fix to prevent negative prices
2. âœ… Enhanced logging for diagnostics
3. ðŸ”„ Monitor logs for patterns of suspicious quotes
4. ðŸ”„ Investigate if specific symbols trigger issues more frequently

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Enhanced Quote Validation at Source**
   - Add validation in `RealTimePriceStore.update_quote_data`
   - Reject quotes with negative/zero prices immediately
   - Log rejected quotes with full context

2. **Quote Freshness Monitoring**
   - Track quote age in milliseconds
   - Alert on stale quotes (> 5 seconds old)
   - Implement quote TTL (time-to-live) mechanism

3. **Data Quality Metrics**
   - Count suspicious quotes per symbol
   - Track REST validation trigger rate
   - Monitor quote rejection rate

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Multiple Data Providers**
   - Add secondary provider (e.g., Polygon.io, IEX)
   - Implement quote consensus algorithm
   - Use median of multiple sources for critical decisions

2. **Quote Sanity Boundaries**
   - Define acceptable price ranges per symbol
   - Reject quotes outside historical ranges
   - Implement circuit breakers for extreme moves

3. **Streaming Reliability Improvements**
   - Implement WebSocket health checks
   - Auto-reconnect on quality degradation
   - Track message latency and gaps

## Additional Fix: Partial Quote Handling

### Problem
Streaming quotes sometimes arrive with only bid OR ask available (the other side is None). The original code rejected these entirely:

```python
# Old code - line 361
if quote_values.bid_price is not None and quote_values.ask_price is not None:
    # Only update if BOTH are present
```

This caused valid partial quotes to be ignored, potentially leaving stale data in the system.

### Solution
Implemented the same fallback logic as the REST API (already present in `market_data_service.py` lines 206-215):

```python
# New code - lines 361-387
if bid_price is not None and ask_price is not None:
    # Both available - use as-is
    pass
elif bid_price is not None:
    # Only bid available - use bid for both sides
    ask_price = bid_price
elif ask_price is not None:
    # Only ask available - use ask for both sides
    bid_price = ask_price
else:
    # Both None - skip update, keep previously stored quote
    return
```

### Behavior
- **Bid-only quote:** Uses bid price for both bid and ask sides
- **Ask-only quote:** Uses ask price for both bid and ask sides
- **Both None:** Keeps previously stored quote (doesn't update)
- **Both present:** Updates normally with both values

This ensures we always have valid quote data even when the data provider sends partial updates, which is common in real-time streaming scenarios.

## Version Update
- **Previous:** 2.20.6
- **Current:** 2.20.7 (PATCH: Bug fixes for negative price handling + partial quote handling)

### Warning Indicators
- Frequent "Invalid quote prices" errors â†’ upstream data quality issue
- Frequent "Cannot apply heavy [bid|ask] side adjustment" â†’ investigate tick size logic
- Frequent REST validation triggers â†’ streaming data quality degraded

### Critical Indicators
- Streaming quotes consistently suspicious â†’ provider issue, increase REST usage
- Emergency $0.01 fallback frequently used â†’ investigate data corruption source
