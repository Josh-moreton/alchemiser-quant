**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Project:** Alchemiser EventBridge Migration  
**Branch:** feat/eventbridge  
**Related PR:** #2502  

## Executive Summary

This document captures lessons learned from the EventBridge migration project to improve future migration efforts. The key takeaway is that **the migration was architecturally sound but suffered from insufficient production validation before declaring "ready for deployment."**

## What Worked Well ✅

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation
**What Happened:**
- Created 10+ detailed documentation files covering architecture, gotchas, troubleshooting
- Documented each bug fix with context and rationale
- Maintained clear history of changes and decisions

**Why It Worked:**
- Made it easy to onboard new reviewers
- Prevented knowledge loss during development
- Enabled effective troubleshooting

**Lesson:**
> 📖 **Comprehensive documentation is invaluable for complex migrations. Document as you go, not after.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Create docs/ folder structure early
- Document decisions in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated with every change
- Write troubleshooting guides during development, not after issues occur

### 2. Infrastructure as Code
**What Happened:**
- Complete AWS infrastructure defined in CloudFormation/SAM template
- Version controlled with proper comments and structure
- All resources tagged and named consistently

**Why It Worked:**
- Easy to review changes in pull requests
- Reproducible deployments across environments
- Clear understanding of resource dependencies

**Lesson:**
> 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code enables reproducible, reviewable deployments. Never configure resources manually.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Start with template.yaml from day one
- Use SAM local for testing before AWS deployment
- Include monitoring and alarms in initial template
- Add CloudFormation drift detection

### 3. Iterative Bug Fixing
**What Happened:**
- Fixed 5+ issues incrementally (serialization, envelope handling, circuit breaker, routing, notifications)
- Each fix was isolated and documented
- System improved progressively without major rewrites

**Why It Worked:**
- Small changes easier to test and validate
- Clear git history showing evolution
- Issues discovered and fixed one at a time

**Lesson:**
> 🔧 **Fix bugs incrementally and document each fix. Small, focused changes are easier to validate.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Document root cause for each bug
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Consider feature flags for progressive rollout

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
**What Happened:**
- Clear separation between business modules via events
- Proper correlation and causation ID propagation
- Idempotent handlers prevent duplicate processing

**Why It Worked:**
- Modules stay independent and testable
- Easy to trace workflows across services
- Resilient to failures and replays

**Lesson:**
> 🎯 **Event-driven architecture provides flexibility and resilience. Invest in proper event design upfront.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Define event schemas early with versioning
- Always include correlation_id in events
- Design handlers to be idempotent from start
- Document event flows with sequence diagrams

## What Didn't Work Well ⚠️

### 1. Delayed Production Validation
**What Happened:**
- System marked "READY FOR DEPLOYMENT" without actual AWS deployment
- Logging issues mentioned but not validated with real CloudWatch logs
- No production metrics or performance data collected

**Why It Failed:**
- Assumed local testing was sufficient
- Didn't prioritize early AWS validation
- Waited too long to get real feedback

**Lesson:**
> 🚨 **Deploy to non-production AWS early and often. Local testing is not enough.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Deploy to AWS dev environment in Week 1
- Collect real CloudWatch logs immediately
- Validate observability before declaring "ready"
- Don't mark "ready for deployment" until actually deployed to staging

### 2. Logging Strategy Afterthought
**What Happened:**
- Logging issues discovered late ("fragmented log streams and excessive verbosity")
- No CloudWatch Insights queries prepared
- No log aggregation strategy defined
- No specific examples of problematic logs

**Why It Failed:**
- Observability treated as nice-to-have, not requirement
- Didn't test log queries across multiple Lambda invocations
- No log volume estimation or cost analysis

**Lesson:**
> 📊 **Design logging and observability FIRST, not last. Bad logs make debugging impossible.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Define logging strategy before writing code
- Create CloudWatch dashboard in Week 1
- Test correlation ID queries across log streams
- Estimate log volume and costs upfront
- Add structured logging standards (JSON format)
- Reduce verbosity in hot paths

### 3. No Operational Runbook
**What Happened:**
- System built and tested but no incident response procedures
- DLQ replay process not documented until review
- No clear escalation paths or alarm response guides
- Operations team not prepared to support system

**Why It Failed:**
- Focused on development, not operations
- Assumed documentation could be written later
- Didn't consider "Day 2" operations during design

**Lesson:**
> 📋 **Create operational runbook during development. Operations is as important as development.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Write runbook in parallel with development
- Document common failure scenarios as they're encountered
- Test incident response procedures before production
- Include runbook in "ready for deployment" checklist
- Train operations team before go-live

### 4. Big-Bang Migration Approach
**What Happened:**
- Migrated entire event system at once (in-memory → EventBridge)
- No hybrid mode or gradual rollout
- All-or-nothing deployment strategy

**Why It Failed:**
- High risk - failure impacts entire system
- Difficult to isolate issues to specific event types
- No fallback to previous system without full rollback

**Lesson:**
> 🎯 **Use incremental migration strategy. Migrate one component at a time with fallback options.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Migrate one event type at a time (e.g., SignalGenerated first)
- Implement dual-write mode (both old and new systems)
- Use feature flags for progressive rollout
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Validate each increment before proceeding

### 5. Missing Production Metrics
**What Happened:**
- No baseline performance metrics collected
- No latency or throughput measurements
- No actual cost data from AWS billing
- No SLAs defined for workflow completion times

**Why It Failed:**
- No way to validate performance is acceptable
- Can't detect performance regressions
- No data-driven decision making

**Lesson:**
> 📈 **Define and measure key performance metrics from day one. What gets measured gets improved.**

**Apply to Future Migrations:**
- Collect baseline metrics before migration
- Define SLAs for critical paths
- Create custom CloudWatch metrics for business events
- Monitor costs in AWS Cost Explorer
- Set up alerting on metric thresholds
- Track metrics in dashboard for visibility

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ "It works on my machine"
**Problem:** Relying on local testing without AWS validation  
**Solution:** Deploy to AWS dev in Week 1, collect real feedback

### ❌ "We'll document it later"
**Problem:** Postponing documentation until after development  
**Solution:** Write docs in parallel with code, make it part of Definition of Done

### ❌ "Big bang deployment"
**Problem:** Migrating entire system at once  
**Solution:** Incremental migration with feature flags and rollback options

### ❌ "Logging is not a priority"
**Problem:** Treating observability as afterthought  
**Solution:** Design logging strategy first, validate early

### ❌ "Ready for deployment" without deployment
**Problem:** Declaring readiness without production validation  
**Solution:** Don't call it "ready" until deployed to staging

### ❌ "Operations can figure it out"
**Problem:** No operational runbook or incident procedures  
**Solution:** Write runbook during development, test incident response
