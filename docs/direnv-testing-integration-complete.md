## 📝 Quick Reference

### Running Tests:
```bash
cd the-alchemiser          # Auto-activates environment
pytest                     # Run all 146 tests
pytest tests/unit/         # Run unit tests only
pytest tests/performance/  # Run performance tests
pytest -k "trading_math"   # Run specific test patterns
```

### Environment Check:
```bash
echo $TRADING_ENV          # Should show: development
which python              # Should show: .venv/bin/python
direnv status             # Shows loaded configuration
```

### Framework Phases:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/ tests/integration/ tests/property/    # Phases 1-3: Foundation
pytest tests/scenarios/ tests/chaos/                     # Phase 4: Advanced
pytest tests/performance/                                # Phase 5: Performance  
pytest tests/monitoring/ tests/regression/ tests/deployment/  # Phase 6: Production
```
