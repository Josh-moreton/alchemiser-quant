# Documentation and CI/CD Action Plan

## Objective
Improve project documentation and establish automated workflows for quality assurance.

## Key Tasks
1. **Documentation Cleanup**
   - Review existing markdown files for outdated or duplicated information.
   - Consolidate overlapping docs and ensure a single source of truth for installation and usage instructions.
2. **Add Build Scripts**
   - Provide reproducible build instructions with pinned dependency versions.
   - Include a Makefile target or script for packaging and deploying to AWS Lambda.
3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that installs dependencies, runs linting, and executes the test suite on every pull request.
   - Add a status badge to the README showing the build status.
4. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Automate Docker image builds and optional deployment to AWS when tests pass on the main branch.
   - Ensure secrets required for deployment are stored securely in GitHub Actions secrets.
5. **Contribution Guide**
   - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining development setup, coding standards, and how to run tests locally.

## Deliverables
- Up-to-date documentation free of redundancies.
- Build and deployment scripts with pinned versions.
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI and optional CD.
- Contribution guidelines for new developers.
