# Trading Bot Test Coverage & Failure Mode Audit

## 1. System Overview
- **Strategy & signals** – The `TECLStrategyEngine` implements multi-step market regime, volatility and sector-rotation logic, selecting leveraged or defensive ETFs based on RSI and moving averages.
- **Order orchestration** – `TradingEngine` (via `ExecutionManager` and `PortfolioRebalancer`) fetches account/position data, consolidates signals and rebalances the portfolio, emitting error context on failure.
- **AWS integration** – The Lambda handler maps EventBridge payloads to CLI modes, enforces default paper trading, and routes failures through a centralized error handler.
- **S3 state & logging** – `S3Handler` encapsulates read/write/append operations with robust error handling, enabling S3-based state persistence and log storage.

## 2. Failure Mode ↔ Test Coverage Mapping
*Legend: **Full** – tests directly target the failure mode; **Partial** – scenario covered indirectly or without edge conditions; **Missing** – no coverage.*

## 3. Additional Blind‑Spot Failure Modes
1. Broker rejects order because order type or time‑in‑force is unsupported.
2. Corporate actions (splits/mergers) causing symbol price jumps or incorrect share quantities.
3. EventBridge fires duplicate events, leading to double trade executions.
4. API returns HTTP 200 with error payload, causing false success assumption.
5. S3 eventual consistency or version conflicts leading to stale or overwritten state.
6. Secrets rotation propagates a bad key; Lambda caches old credentials.
7. Lambda hits ephemeral storage limit from local log accumulation.
8. Broker or data provider switches quote currency, causing mispriced trades.
9. CloudWatch subscription filters misconfigured, so alerts never trigger.
10. Exchange-wide trading halt or circuit-breaker event resumes at different times across venues.

## 4. Test Suite Robustness
- **Execution:** `pytest` run currently fails due to missing dependencies (`psutil`, `hypothesis`), blocking test execution.
- **Determinism:** Many simulation/chaos tests rely on random number generators without seeding, risking flaky results.
- **Fixtures & mocking:** Extensive usage of pytest fixtures and mocks for Alpaca, AWS, and market data.
- **Separation:** Clear directory structure for unit, integration, simulation, and infrastructure tests.
- **Negative scenarios:** Chaos tests cover API/network/memory failures, but broker-side edge cases (partial fills, acknowledgments) are absent.

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps

### High-Priority Missing/Weak Tests
| Priority | Failure Mode | Suggested Test Outline (pytest) |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| P0 | Partial fills & duplicate positions | Mock broker returning successive partial fills; verify order reconciliation and idempotent retry logic. |
| P0 | Margin/buying-power constraints | Mock account with low buying power; expect order rejection and graceful fallback. |
| P0 | Order acknowledgments lost/out-of-order | Simulate network drop after broker ACK; ensure client-side IDs prevent duplicates. |
| P0 | Secrets rotation/unavailability | Rotate secret mid-run or raise `ResourceNotFound`; assert cached fallback and alert. |
| P1 | EventBridge duplicate triggers | Invoke Lambda handler twice with same event ID; confirm idempotent trade execution. |
| P1 | S3 eventual consistency & corrupted data | Write/read with delayed visibility or malformed JSON; check retries and schema validation. |
| P1 | Holiday/market halt schedule | Parameterize trading days around known holidays; expect bot to skip execution. |
| P2 | Logging/monitoring gaps | Disable CloudWatch or simulate quota breach; assert fallback logging and alert. |
| P2 | CloudFormation drift & VPC misconfig | Use `moto` to simulate missing IAM permissions or unreachable VPC endpoints. |
| P2 | Float precision drift over long runs | Replay multi-day historical data; assert cumulative P&L matches Decimal calculations. |

### Strengthening the Suite
1. **Dependency Management:** Ensure test extras install `psutil`, `hypothesis`, `moto` etc. in CI to avoid collection errors.
2. **Deterministic Simulations:** Seed RNGs in scenario and chaos tests; capture seeds in test output for reproducibility.
3. **Comprehensive Mocking:** Extend `tests/utils/mocks.py` with partial-fill responses, rate-limit headers, and Secrets Manager failures.
4. **End-to-End Replay:** Add historical data replay tests verifying multi-day order flow and S3 state evolution.
5. **Regression & Alerts:** Automate P&L regression over rolling windows and verify CloudWatch alarms fire for log or metric anomalies.
6. **Security Automation:** Add static analysis (e.g., `bandit`, `pip-audit`) and tests ensuring secrets never appear in logs.
7. **CI Gatekeeping:** Enforce coverage thresholds and run chaos/simulation tests in nightly jobs to monitor resilience.

## Testing
- `pytest` (fails: missing `psutil`, `hypothesis`)
