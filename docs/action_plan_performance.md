# Performance Action Plan

## Objective
Improve execution speed and efficiency of market interactions.

## Key Tasks
1. **Remove Arbitrary Sleeps**
   - Replace fixed `time.sleep` calls in `smart_execution.py` with asynchronous waiting based on order status events.
   - Leverage WebSocket streaming to monitor fills in real time.
2. **Batch Price Requests**
   - Implement a price caching layer or bulk quote retrieval to minimize API requests.
   - Reuse HTTP sessions or WebSocket connections where applicable.
3. **Asynchronous Design**
   - Evaluate converting blocking execution flows to use `asyncio` for concurrency.
   - Ensure compatibility with existing WebSocket monitoring utilities.
4. **Benchmarking**
   - Profile current execution latency and identify bottlenecks.
   - Create performance regression tests to ensure new implementation meets targets.
5. **Documentation**
   - Document recommended hardware and network settings for optimal performance.
   - Provide tuning guidelines for order timeout and slippage parameters.

## Deliverables
- Updated execution modules using event-driven waits.
- Batched price request utilities and connection reuse.
- Benchmark results showing reduced latency.
- Documentation on performance tuning and benchmarks.
