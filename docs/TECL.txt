TECL For The Long Term Strategy – Decision Logic Guide

1. High-Level Strategy Intent Overview

Strategy Goal: This trading strategy aims to capture long-term gains from the technology sector (via the TECL ETF, a 3× leveraged tech-focused fund) during favorable market conditions, while protecting capital during unfavorable periods. It dynamically shifts between aggressive risk-on positions (like leveraged equity ETFs) and defensive positions (like cash-equivalents, bonds, or volatility hedges) based on market trends and momentum signals.

Core Idea: The strategy predominantly wants to be long tech equities (TECL) for growth, but it uses a series of conditional rules to decide when to be in or out of that position. It looks at broad market trend (using the S&P 500 as a proxy) and short-term momentum indicators (specifically Relative Strength Index (RSI) values on various assets) to determine whether to buy into tech, hold a defensive stance (cash/bonds), or even short the market. The intent is to ride bullish trends in technology stocks for as long as they’re sustainable, step aside (or hedge) when the market looks overextended or risky, and even take contrarian or short positions in downturns to profit or protect the portfolio.

Regime Switching: A key component is a 200-day moving average filter on the S&P 500 (SPY) to distinguish between a bull market regime and a bear/uncertain regime. When SPY’s price is above its 200-day moving average, the strategy treats it as a bullish environment (risk-taking is favored). When SPY is below the 200-day average, it’s treated as a bearish or high-risk environment (strategy becomes cautious or opportunistic with contrarian trades). This long-term trend indicator sets the overall context for decision-making.

Momentum and Mean-Reversion Signals: Within each regime, the strategy then uses shorter-term RSI signals on various instruments to fine-tune decisions:
	•	Overbought RSI signals (high RSI) trigger the strategy to reduce risk – either by moving to cash/T-Bills (BIL is used as a cash-equivalent ETF) or by hedging with volatility instruments (UVXY, a VIX futures ETF) – anticipating that an overextended market may pull back.
	•	Oversold RSI signals (low RSI) trigger contrarian risk-on moves – the strategy will buy into equity positions (like TECL or SPXL – a 3× S&P 500 bull fund) when these are extremely oversold, expecting a rebound.
	•	Relative strength comparison (comparing tech sector momentum vs. a managed futures strategy KMLM) helps determine if tech stocks are the best place to be or if they are underperforming relative to an alternative trend-following strategy. If tech is lagging, the strategy opts for safety or even short positions instead of staying long tech.
	•	Volatility indicator: The strategy monitors UVXY’s RSI as a proxy for market volatility conditions. A spike in UVXY’s RSI suggests rising volatility (fear) in the market – the strategy responds by increasing cash or adding a small volatility hedge.

In summary, the strategy’s intent is to maximize participation in tech-led rallies (leveraged via TECL) during bullish periods, step out or hedge when the rally is overextended (to avoid drawdowns), and adapt in bearish periods by either staying safe (cash/bonds), taking contrarian long positions on severe dips, or even shorting the market when downtrend momentum is strong. All decisions are rules-based, driven by the predefined thresholds on technical indicators and comparisons, ensuring a systematic approach a senior quant trader can follow and implement.

2. Step-by-Step Decision-Making Process (Decision Tree Breakdown)

The logic of the strategy can be viewed as a decision tree with sequential checks. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of all the conditional branches and their resulting actions (buy/sell/hold decisions in terms of what position the strategy takes). The process is divided into two main branches based on the market regime:

Step 1: Determine Market Regime (Trend Filter)
	•	Check if the S&P 500 (SPY) is in an uptrend: Is SPY’s current price above its 200-day moving average?
	•	If YES (Bull Market Regime): The market’s long-term trend is positive. The strategy will favor long tech exposure (TECL) when short-term conditions are favorable, but will switch to defense if signals indicate the market is overheated. Proceed to Bull Regime logic below.
	•	If NO (Bear Market Regime): The market is in a downtrend or uncertain phase. The strategy will be mostly defensive, but will take opportunistic trades (either contrarian longs or even shorts) based on short-term signals. Proceed to Bear Regime logic below.

Step 2A: Bull Market Regime – SPY Above 200-Day MA

(In a bull regime, the strategy’s baseline is to be risk-on with tech, but it has safeguards for overbought conditions.)
	1.	Tech Momentum Overbought Check: Is the 10-day RSI of TQQQ > 79? (TQQQ is a 3× leveraged Nasdaq-100 ETF, used here to gauge aggressive tech momentum.)
	•	If YES (TQQQ RSI > 79, extremely high): The tech sector’s short-term momentum is very overbought. This is a warning sign that the rally might be overextended. Action: The strategy immediately adopts a defensive posture by moving to a protective allocation 25% in UVXY and 75% in BIL. In other words, it places a quarter of the portfolio in a volatility hedge (UVXY, an inverse VIX futures ETF) and the rest in cash-equivalents (BIL, a 1–3 month T-bill ETF). This mix anticipates a potential pullback: UVXY can spike if volatility surges (offsetting equity losses), while BIL preserves capital. The strategy will hold this defensive mix until conditions change. (Effectively, this is a “sell/hedge” signal triggered by overheated tech momentum.)
	•	If NO (TQQQ RSI ≤ 79): Tech’s momentum is not at an extreme. No immediate overbought warning from TQQQ. Continue to next condition.
	2.	Broad Market Overbought Check: Is the 10-day RSI of SPY > 80? (Even in a bull trend, check if the broad market itself is overbought short-term.)
	•	If YES (SPY RSI > 80, extremely high): The overall market is short-term overbought. This suggests a high risk of a near-term pullback despite the long-term uptrend. Action: The strategy goes defensive with the 25% UVXY + 75% BIL allocation (same as above). It hedges and takes cover in cash because an overheated SPY could mean a broad market correction is due. (This is another “sell/hedge” trigger – taking risk off the table when the market’s momentum is too strong to likely sustain.)
	•	If NO (SPY RSI ≤ 80): The market isn’t extremely overbought. It’s a bull regime with manageable momentum levels. Continue to next decision.
	3.	Tech vs. Alternatives Momentum (“KMLM Switcher”) Check: Now that no extreme overbought conditions were flagged, the strategy decides whether to be in tech or not by comparing tech sector momentum to an alternative strategy. It asks: Is the 10-day RSI of XLK greater than the 10-day RSI of KMLM?
	•	XLK is the Technology Sector SPDR (non-leveraged tech sector ETF), representing the tech sector’s performance.
	•	KMLM is a Managed Futures Strategy ETF (tracks a diversified futures index). KMLM’s performance can represent a trend-following alternative, often doing well in different conditions (including bearish ones).
	•	Interpretation: This comparison gauges relative strength – if tech (XLK) is outperforming a diversified managed futures strategy (KMLM) in the short term. A higher RSI for XLK means tech momentum is stronger than that of KMLM. This helps the strategy decide whether to focus on tech or step back: if tech is not the strongest, maybe conditions favor other strategies (or warrant caution).
	•	If YES (XLK RSI > KMLM RSI, tech momentum leads): Tech sector is showing stronger momentum than the alternatives, so it’s favorable to be in tech provided no other red flags. The strategy will lean into the tech rally, with one more safety check:
	1.	Tech Overbought within Bull Check: Is XLK’s 10-day RSI > 81? (An even more stringent check on tech sector itself for being overbought.)
	•	If YES (XLK RSI > 81, extremely overbought): The tech sector, despite leading, is now too hot on a short-term basis. This is a caution flag that even within a bull market, tech’s run-up might be stretched. Action: The strategy opts for safety and moves entirely to cash (100% BIL). By going fully into BIL (T-bill ETF), it effectively “takes profits” or holds off on buying tech until the overheating subsides. (This is a hold/safe decision – avoid buying at an overbought peak.)
	•	If NO (XLK RSI ≤ 81): Tech momentum is strong and not at an extreme. Action: Go risk-on with tech – allocate 100% to TECL, the 3× leveraged tech stock ETF. In this scenario, conditions are ideal: the market trend is up, tech is leading the charge, and not overbought. The strategy seizes the opportunity by fully investing in leveraged tech to maximize gains. (This is a buy/hold long tech signal.)
	•	If NO (XLK RSI ≤ KMLM RSI, tech momentum is not stronger): Tech is not leading at the moment – an alternative strategy (like managed futures as proxied by KMLM) shows equal or stronger momentum. This could imply the environment isn’t purely favoring tech (perhaps other asset classes are doing well, or tech is lagging). In a bull regime, the strategy does not short (since overall market is still in an uptrend), but it will become cautious on tech unless a strong mean-reversion signal appears:
	1.	Tech Oversold within Bull Check: Is XLK’s 10-day RSI < 29? (Check if tech sector is extremely oversold in the short term.)
	•	If YES (XLK RSI < 29, very oversold): Tech has pulled back significantly (despite the bull regime). This presents a contrarian buying opportunity. Action: Allocate 100% to TECL – effectively “buy the dip” in tech. The strategy assumes that in a broader uptrend, an oversold tech sector is likely to rebound, so it takes a long position at a discount. (This is a buy signal triggered by an oversold condition.)
	•	If NO (XLK RSI ≥ 29, not oversold and tech isn’t leading): Tech is neither strongly leading nor extremely oversold – essentially a middling scenario for tech in an otherwise bullish market. Without a compelling reason to be in tech, the strategy stays on the sidelines in this case. Action: Go fully defensive in cash (100% BIL). By moving to BIL, the strategy avoids a tech position when the edge is unclear (it chooses not to short in a bull regime, hence the only “off” position is staying in safe cash). (This can be viewed as a hold capital decision – neither long nor short, just waiting in a safe asset.)

(At this point, the bull-market branch of the decision tree ends. The outcome will be one of the following positions: a full allocation to TECL, a full allocation to BIL, or a hedged mix of UVXY & BIL – depending on which of the above conditions were met. These outcomes are summarized in section 5.)

Step 2B: Bear Market Regime – SPY Below 200-Day MA

(In a bear regime or downtrend, the strategy’s baseline is defensive, but it looks for chances to either go long on extreme dips or take short positions. The logic is more complex here due to the variety of possible defensive moves.)
	1.	Tech Severely Oversold Check (Contrarian entry): Is the 10-day RSI of TQQQ < 31?
	•	This checks if the tech-heavy Nasdaq (using TQQQ’s RSI as a proxy) is extremely oversold. In a bear market, such an oversold reading could precede a sharp bounce (a relief rally).
	•	If YES (TQQQ RSI < 31): The tech sector has been beaten down to an extreme degree short-term. The strategy attempts a contrarian long trade despite the bearish environment. Action: Allocate 100% to TECL, the 3× long tech ETF, to catch an oversold rebound. The idea is that even in downtrends, markets have powerful rallies (bear market rallies), and an extremely low RSI is an opportunity to profit from such a bounce. (This is a buy signal in a bear regime, going against the prevailing trend because conditions are ripe for a mean-reversion move.)
	•	If NO (TQQQ RSI ≥ 31): Tech isn’t deeply oversold (it’s either neutral or only moderately weak). No automatic contrarian trade. The strategy remains cautious and continues to the next check.
	2.	Broad Market Oversold Check (Contrarian entry): Is the 10-day RSI of SPXL < 29?
	•	SPXL is a 3× leveraged S&P 500 ETF. An RSI below 29 here means the broad market (S&P 500) is extremely oversold in the short term.
	•	If YES (SPXL RSI < 29): The overall market is at a pessimistic extreme. This is another opportunity for a contrarian rally trade. Action: Allocate 100% to SPXL, the leveraged S&P 500 long fund, to capture a potential snap-back rally in the broad market. The strategy chooses SPXL (broad market exposure) in this case because the signal is on the broad index itself being oversold. (This is a buy signal on the S&P during a downtrend, expecting a bounce.)
	•	If NO (SPXL RSI ≥ 29): The broad market is not at an extreme oversold level. The strategy doesn’t initiate a contrarian long on the market. Continue to the next condition (staying defensive unless something else triggers).
	3.	Volatility Spike Check: Is the 10-day RSI of UVXY > 74?
	•	Here the strategy checks the level of market volatility. UVXY (a leveraged VIX futures ETF) having a high RSI indicates that volatility (fear) has been surging recently. In a bear regime, a volatility spike often coincides with market sell-offs or panic. The strategy adjusts its defense depending on how extreme the volatility is:
	•	If YES (UVXY RSI > 74, volatility rising sharply): There’s significant stress in the market. The strategy prioritizes capital protection and possibly profiting from volatility. It applies a two-tier response based on how extreme the vol spike is:
	1.	Extreme Volatility Check: Is UVXY’s 10-day RSI > 84? (This checks if volatility is not just high, but extremely high – indicating a possible capitulation moment or imminent reversal in volatility.)
	•	If YES (UVXY RSI > 84, extremely high volatility): This is an exceptional situation – volatility is at an extreme. The strategy takes a partial volatility hedge while mostly staying safe. Action: Allocate 15% to UVXY and 85% to BIL. In this scenario, holding a small portion in UVXY can yield gains if volatility continues spiking, but keeping the majority in cash (BIL) protects the bulk of the capital. The 15/85 split is a very cautious stance, acknowledging the chance of a volatility reversal (since volatility usually mean-reverts from extreme highs, one doesn’t want too large a UVXY position) but still hedging some. (This is a defensive/hedging action for crisis conditions.)
	•	If NO (UVXY RSI 75–84, moderately high): Volatility is elevated but not at historical extremes. This suggests risk is high, but perhaps not at a blow-off stage yet. The strategy opts to be completely safe. Action: Go 100% to BIL (cash). By moving entirely to short-term Treasuries (BIL), the strategy avoids market exposure and sits out the storm. This full cash position protects the portfolio in a high-volatility environment where both stocks and bonds could be turbulent. (This is a strong defensive move – essentially a “sit in cash until volatility calms down” decision.)
	•	If NO (UVXY RSI ≤ 74): Volatility readings are not particularly high (at least not spiking beyond normal ranges). The bear market may be calmer or grinding downwards without panic. In the absence of a volatility alarm, the strategy next looks at relative asset momentum to decide how to position: continue to next step.
	4.	Tech vs. Alternatives Momentum Check (in Bear): Just like in the bull regime, the strategy compares tech sector momentum to the managed futures strategy as a guide. Is XLK’s 10-day RSI > KMLM’s 10-day RSI?
	•	If YES (XLK RSI > KMLM RSI, tech is relatively stronger): Even though the market is in a downtrend, the tech sector is showing more strength (or less weakness) compared to the managed futures benchmark. This suggests that if one is to take any risk, tech might be the better place than elsewhere. The strategy will consider a tech position, with an important caution:
	1.	Tech Overbought in Bear Check: Is XLK’s 10-day RSI > 81?
	•	If YES (XLK RSI > 81, overbought): In a bear environment, seeing tech’s RSI this high likely means a sharp bear-market rally just occurred. Even if tech has been stronger, it’s now overheated. The strategy doesn’t chase this rally further. Action: Stay defensive with 100% BIL. (It effectively takes profits or waits rather than buying into an overbought surge in a downtrend.)
	•	If NO (XLK RSI ≤ 81): Tech has relative strength and isn’t overbought. This implies a potential opportunity to be long tech even in a bearish regime, because tech is holding up well or recovering and momentum is on its side. Action: Allocate 100% to TECL (leveraged tech long). The strategy goes long tech here, betting that tech will continue to outperform and deliver gains despite the broader downtrend, at least in the short term. (This is a buy signal for tech during a bear phase, justified by tech’s relative momentum.)
	•	If NO (XLK RSI ≤ KMLM RSI, tech is not leading): Tech is underperforming relative to the managed futures benchmark – in a bear market, this often means tech is weak (which is typical in downturns) and perhaps other asset classes (commodities, bonds, etc., which KMLM could represent) are doing better. In this case, the strategy avoids a straightforward long tech position unless a clear oversold opportunity exists. It also considers a short position as an alternative. The logic splits into two possibilities:
	1.	Tech Oversold in Bear Check: Is XLK’s 10-day RSI < 29?
	•	If YES (XLK RSI < 29, extremely oversold): The tech sector has sold off heavily (and it’s also not been leading, meaning tech is especially weak). Such an oversold condition can precede a bounce even in a downtrend. Action: Allocate 100% to TECL for a contrarian rebound trade. Despite tech’s relative weakness, the sheer degree of oversold condition prompts the strategy to attempt a quick long position, expecting at least a short-term recovery. (This is a buy signal to “buy the extreme dip” in tech, even though it’s against the recent relative trend.)
	•	If NO (XLK RSI ≥ 29, tech not oversold and still not leading): Tech is neither oversold enough to buy nor strong enough to warrant a long position. In a bear regime, with tech weak, the strategy now considers offensive defensive tactics – it can either short the market or stay in bonds, depending on which is more favorable. This is the one scenario where the strategy will take a short position. Action: Momentum-based choice between a short tech position and a bond position: The strategy will compare the 9-day RSI of two assets – SQQQ vs. BSV – and invest 100% in whichever has the higher RSI (stronger momentum). Specifically:
	•	SQQQ is the 3× inverse Nasdaq-100 ETF (short position on tech stocks). A higher RSI on SQQQ means the short trade is trending strongly (tech stocks are consistently falling, so SQQQ is rising in value).
	•	BSV is a short-term bond ETF. A higher RSI on BSV means bonds are performing well (capital is flowing into safer short-term bonds).
	•	The strategy picks the asset with greater upward momentum as the better defensive play in this scenario:
	•	If SQQQ’s RSI is higher than BSV’s, it indicates the market decline is robust (shorting is working). The strategy will allocate 100% to SQQQ, profiting from further tech stock declines. (This is a sell/short decision – effectively shorting the tech market because downward momentum is dominant.)
	•	If BSV’s RSI is higher, it suggests bonds are currently a safer or more stable haven (perhaps yields are dropping or investors are flocking to safety). The strategy will allocate 100% to BSV, choosing a long bond position for safety. (This is a defensive hold decision – staying in bonds rather than shorting, as bonds show better performance.)
	•	This dynamic rule ensures the strategy is adaptive: in a weak tech scenario during a bear market, it will follow the stronger defensive trend – either take advantage of the market weakness via a short, or sit in bonds if they’re offering better risk-adjusted returns.

(This concludes the bear-market branch of the decision tree. The possible outcomes here range from fully defensive (cash or bonds) to contrarian longs (TECL, SPXL) or a short position (SQQQ), depending on the combination of conditions. All unique outcomes are summarized in section 5.)

3. Explanation of Key Rules & Logic Gates in Plain English

To ensure each decision rule is crystal clear, here is a summary of each major condition (logic gate) used in the strategy and its effect on the trading decisions. These rules are the building blocks of the decision tree described above:
	•	Market Trend Regime (SPY 200-day Moving Average): This is the first gate. If the S&P 500 is trading above its 200-day moving average, the strategy considers the market to be in an uptrend (bullish regime) and will seek long opportunities in tech or go to cash – but will not short. If SPY is below the 200-day MA, it’s a downtrend (bearish regime) and the strategy becomes defensive or opportunistic with shorts/contrarian trades. This long-term trend filter prevents the strategy from being aggressively long during overall downtrends and from shorting during healthy uptrends.
	•	Tech Overbought Signal (TQQQ RSI > 79 in bull regime): TQQQ’s 10-day RSI crossing above 79 indicates extreme bullish momentum in tech. In a bull market, such a reading is treated as a sign of overextension (potential imminent reversal). Trigger: When this condition is met, the strategy sells out of risk assets and moves to a defensive hedge (25% UVXY, 75% BIL). Essentially, it’s taking profits on longs and bracing for a volatility spike or pullback. (This is a sell/hedge rule – it triggers a protective stance to preserve gains.)
	•	Broad Market Overbought Signal (SPY RSI > 80 in bull regime): If the S&P 500’s 10-day RSI goes above 80, the entire market is short-term overbought. Trigger: The strategy responds by moving to the 25% UVXY, 75% BIL defensive allocation (similar to the TQQQ rule). Even though the trend is up, this rule prevents the strategy from holding a long position when the market is overheating. (Another sell/hedge trigger for risk reduction.)
	•	Tech vs. Managed Futures Strength (XLK RSI vs. KMLM RSI): This is a relative strength rule comparing tech sector momentum to an alternative strategy.
	•	If XLK’s RSI is higher than KMLM’s RSI, it means tech is the stronger trend – the strategy then leans toward tech exposure (if no other extreme signals contradict it).
	•	If XLK’s RSI is lower or equal to KMLM’s, tech is not leading – the strategy becomes cautious on tech: it will either stay in safe assets or consider shorts (in a bear regime) unless an oversold condition in tech prompts a contrarian buy.
	•	In practice: This rule decides whether to favor long tech or not, based on comparative momentum. It’s essentially saying “Is tech where the strength is right now, or would we be better off avoiding/shorting tech?” It does not directly trigger a trade by itself, but routes the decision tree down different paths (tech-favored vs. tech-not-favored branches).
	•	Tech Sector Overbought Threshold (XLK RSI > 81): This rule is applied when the strategy is otherwise inclined to be long tech (for example, tech is leading in momentum). If the tech sector’s RSI exceeds 81, it’s labeled extremely overbought. Trigger: The strategy will not take a long tech position in this case; instead it goes 100% to cash (BIL). This ensures the strategy doesn’t jump into (or stays in) a tech position when the sector is overheated and vulnerable to a pullback. (Effect: it’s a fail-safe that forces a “hold/stand aside” instead of buying into an overbought rally.)
	•	Tech Sector Oversold Threshold (XLK RSI < 29): This rule spots when tech is extremely oversold. If XLK’s RSI dips below 29 (a very low level), it implies capitulation or panic selling in tech. Trigger: The strategy will take a contrarian long position in TECL (3× tech), betting on a rebound. This rule appears in both bull and bear regimes whenever tech is deeply oversold: in a bull market, it suggests a dip buy; in a bear market, it suggests a sharp counter-trend rally might occur. (Effect: it generates a “buy the dip” signal for tech when pessimism is extreme.)
	•	Nasdaq/Tech Oversold Threshold (TQQQ RSI < 31 in bear regime): Similar in spirit to the above, but specifically using TQQQ in the context of a downtrend. If the leveraged Nasdaq’s RSI falls below 31 during a bear regime, it indicates an extreme short-term oversold condition in tech-heavy stocks. Trigger: The strategy buys TECL (long tech) to catch a potential bounce. (This is essentially the bear-market counterpart to the oversold tech rule, using TQQQ as the gauge. It makes the strategy aggresssively step in with a long position even in a downtrend if selling seems overdone.)
	•	Broad Market Oversold Threshold (SPXL RSI < 29 in bear regime): If the 3× S&P 500 ETF’s RSI drops under 29 in a bearish regime, the broad market is extremely oversold. Trigger: The strategy will buy SPXL (leveraged S&P) as a contrarian trade, expecting a broad relief rally. This rule is specifically looking at the S&P; it ensures the strategy can also play a rebound in the whole market, not just tech, when conditions are exceptionally oversold.
	•	Volatility Spike Thresholds (UVXY RSI > 74 and > 84): These rules handle how to respond to surges in volatility:
	•	If UVXY’s RSI > 74, volatility is high – the strategy turns very defensive. It will either go fully to cash (BIL) or use a small UVXY hedge, depending on intensity:
	•	If UVXY RSI > 84 (extremely high vol): The strategy assumes a risk of market capitulation or a volatility climax. It stays mostly in cash but allocates a minor portion (15%) to UVXY as a hedge, in case volatility continues spiking. This way, if markets keep falling, the UVXY hedge can profit and offset some losses, but the exposure is limited to avoid too much risk if volatility collapses after the spike.
	•	If UVXY RSI is between 74 and 84 (high but not peak): The strategy doesn’t take any risky positions at all – it goes 100% cash, avoiding both stocks and volatility bets, until the turmoil subsides.
	•	These rules ensure the strategy preserves capital during turbulence. Essentially, a high UVXY RSI is a “fear gauge” – the higher it gets, the more the strategy pulls back from the market and the more it might even tilt slightly into volatility hedges.
	•	Short vs. Bonds Momentum Rule (SQQQ vs BSV RSI comparison): This rule comes into play in a bear regime when tech is underperforming and not extremely oversold – a scenario where being long is not attractive. The strategy must choose the best defensive/offensive position: short the market or stay in bonds? It resolves this by comparing momentum:
	•	It looks at the 9-day RSI of SQQQ (3× inverse short Nasdaq) vs. that of BSV (short-term bond ETF).
	•	If SQQQ’s RSI is higher, it means the short position on tech has stronger upward momentum (tech stocks are consistently falling). The strategy interprets this as a good opportunity to be short, so it will allocate fully to SQQQ, effectively shorting tech to profit from the decline.
	•	If BSV’s RSI is higher, it implies bonds are doing relatively better (money flowing into bonds, perhaps interest rates dropping). In that case, the safer play is to hold bonds (100% BSV) rather than shorting stocks.
	•	This dynamic rule is basically a performance chase between two defensive assets: it ensures the strategy is in whichever of the two is performing better. It results in either a short position (sell equities) or a bond position (hold safe yield assets), depending on market conditions. This is the strategy’s way of still trying to gain in a downtrend — either by short selling or by earning from bonds — instead of just sitting in cash, but doing so based on measurable momentum.

Each of these rules triggers specific buy/hold/sell decisions as described. In practice, the strategy will evaluate them in the order given by the decision tree. For example, some rules are only considered in the bull regime and some only in the bear regime. Together, they cover a wide range of market conditions, dictating exactly how the strategy should rebalance the portfolio (daily, since the strategy’s rebalance frequency is daily per the code) into the appropriate asset allocation.

4. Key Input Data & Indicators (Signals Driving Decisions)

This strategy relies on a variety of input data signals – mostly technical indicators – to make its decisions. Below is a list of the key inputs and how each affects the strategy’s moves:
	•	SPY 200-Day Moving Average (Trend Indicator): The relationship between the S&P 500’s price and its 200-day MA is used to determine the market regime.
	•	Above 200-day MA: Signals a bullish trend – activates the bullish branch of the strategy (favoring long tech positions or cash, no shorts).
	•	Below 200-day MA: Signals a bearish trend – activates the bearish branch (favoring safety, contrarian trades, or short positions).
	•	10-Day RSI of TQQQ (Leveraged Nasdaq-100 ETF): Used as an indicator of extreme tech momentum.
	•	RSI > 79: In a bull regime, this triggers a defensive hedge (25% UVXY + 75% BIL) to protect against a likely pullback (tech is very overbought).
	•	RSI < 31: In a bear regime, this triggers a contrarian buy of TECL (100% allocation) to catch an oversold bounce (tech is very oversold).
	•	10-Day RSI of SPY (S&P 500): Used to gauge broad market momentum on a short horizon.
	•	RSI > 80: In a bull regime, signals the broad market is overbought – the strategy goes defensive (25% UVXY + 75% BIL) even if the trend is up, to avoid staying long at a high-risk point.
	•	(RSI low thresholds for SPY are not explicitly used; instead, SPXL’s RSI is used for oversold conditions, see below.)
	•	10-Day RSI of XLK (Technology Sector ETF) vs. 10-Day RSI of KMLM (Managed Futures ETF): This pair is used for relative strength analysis.
	•	XLK RSI > KMLM RSI: Tech sector has stronger recent momentum than the managed futures strategy. The strategy interprets this as a green light to favor tech exposure (provided no other caution flags).
	•	XLK RSI ≤ KMLM RSI: Tech momentum is lagging. The strategy becomes cautious or avoids tech: in a bull regime it means go to cash unless tech is oversold; in a bear regime it could lead to shorting or bonds instead of tech longs.
	•	Why these two? KMLM represents a trend-following strategy across different asset classes (commodities, currencies, bonds). Comparing tech to KMLM helps the strategy decide if equities (tech) are the place to be or if trends are stronger elsewhere (which often is the case in bear markets or inflationary environments, etc.). It’s a unique signal that boosts or dampens the strategy’s confidence in tech positions.
	•	Absolute RSI Levels for XLK (Tech Sector): The strategy checks XLK’s RSI against fixed thresholds to trigger specific actions:
	•	XLK RSI > 81: Extremely overbought tech. If the strategy was inclined to be long tech, this stops it – the strategy will move to cash (BIL) instead, to avoid overexposure at a peak.
	•	XLK RSI < 29: Extremely oversold tech. This prompts a buy of TECL as a mean-reversion play (in either regime, if this condition is reached and no higher-priority rule has already triggered). It’s a strong “buy the dip” signal for tech.
	•	10-Day RSI of SPXL (3× S&P 500 ETF): Used only in the bear regime to identify broad market oversold conditions.
	•	SPXL RSI < 29: Extremely oversold S&P 500. Triggers a contrarian buy of SPXL (leveraged long S&P) to catch a broad market rebound. This is essentially the strategy’s way of saying, “Even though we’re in a downtrend, the market has sold off so hard that a bounce is likely – let’s take advantage of it.”
	•	10-Day RSI of UVXY (2× VIX Futures ETF): Serves as a volatility alarm.
	•	UVXY RSI > 74: Volatility is significantly elevated – the strategy goes into capital preservation mode.
	•	If 75–84: High vol but not the peak – go 100% BIL (all cash) to wait it out safely.
	•	If ≥ 85: Exceptionally high vol – go 85% BIL + 15% UVXY (mostly cash with a small long volatility hedge). The small UVXY stake can profit if volatility keeps surging, providing a hedge, while most capital stays safe.
	•	If UVXY’s RSI is below 74, volatility isn’t signaling panic, and the strategy doesn’t enact those special volatility defenses – it will rely on other signals to guide positions.
	•	9-Day RSI of SQQQ (3× Inverse Nasdaq) vs. 9-Day RSI of BSV (Short-Term Bond ETF): This comparative signal is used in specific bearish scenarios when deciding between a short equity position and a bond position.
	•	The strategy will compute recent momentum for both shorting tech (via SQQQ) and holding bonds (via BSV).
	•	Whichever asset has the higher RSI (meaning it has stronger positive momentum/trend) will be chosen for a 100% allocation.
	•	This effectively means:
	•	If SQQQ RSI > BSV RSI: shorting Nasdaq (tech) is working better – the strategy will short tech via SQQQ.
	•	If BSV RSI > SQQQ RSI: bonds are doing better – the strategy will stay in bonds via BSV.
	•	This input ensures the strategy is data-driven in choosing how to defend/gain in a bear regime – following whichever safe-haven or bearish trade is currently most effective.

Data Summary: In aggregate, the strategy pulls data on moving averages (for trend), and RSIs on multiple instruments (SPY, TQQQ, XLK, KMLM, SPXL, UVXY, SQQQ, BSV) with window lengths around 9–10 days. These indicators are its “sensors” to gauge market state. Each indicator’s threshold is carefully set (around 80+ for overbought, 30-ish for oversold, mid-70s for volatility alarm) to reflect extreme conditions. The strategy’s logic uses these inputs to decide allocation – effectively translating these signals into portfolio actions (which asset to buy or hold at any given day). By adjusting the portfolio only when these conditions are met, the strategy avoids emotional trading and sticks to a systematic process.

5. All Possible Outcomes of the Strategy

Based on the combination of signals above, the strategy will always end up in one of several discrete portfolio positions at any given time. Each is a specific allocation to one or two assets. Below is a list of all possible outcome positions the strategy can take, along with the typical scenario that leads to each outcome:
	•	100% in TECL – Full Tech Exposure (Leveraged Long Tech):
Outcome: The entire portfolio is invested in TECL, the Direxion Daily Tech Bull 3× Shares ETF.
Triggers/Scenario: This is the default risk-on position when conditions are favorable for tech:
	•	In a bull market regime, this happens when tech momentum is positive and not overbought. For example, SPY is above 200MA, no extreme RSI warnings (TQQQ ≤ 79, SPY ≤ 80), and tech is leading (XLK RSI > KMLM RSI) without being overheated (XLK RSI ≤ 81). The strategy goes all-in on tech to capitalize on the uptrend.
	•	In a bear market regime, a 100% TECL position occurs only in contrarian or relative-strength situations: either tech has become extremely oversold (TQQQ RSI < 31 or XLK RSI < 29 triggers a contrarian buy despite the downtrend), or the tech sector shows strong relative momentum in a downtrend (XLK RSI > KMLM RSI and XLK RSI ≤ 81, indicating tech is holding up well and can be bought even in a bear environment). In both cases, the strategy is effectively taking a calculated risk that tech will rise.
	•	100% in SPXL – Broad Market Long (Leveraged S&P 500):
Outcome: The entire portfolio is invested in SPXL, the Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bull 3× Shares ETF.
Triggers/Scenario: This position is taken in a bear market regime when the broad market is extremely oversold (SPXL’s own RSI < 29). In a downtrend, if the S&P 500 has dropped to an extreme degree, the strategy buys SPXL expecting a bounce in the overall market. This is a contrarian long on the S&P 500 during a rough period. (In a bull regime, the strategy doesn’t specifically use SPXL because TECL is the preferred vehicle for long exposure; SPXL only appears as a choice in the downtrend oversold context.)
	•	100% in BIL – Full Cash Position (T-Bill ETF):
Outcome: The entire portfolio goes to BIL, the SPDR 1–3 Month T-Bill ETF, which is basically a cash proxy or very short-term government debt. This is the safest, most defensive stance (no equity exposure, just stable, low-risk holdings).
Triggers/Scenario: The strategy moves to a full cash position under several cautionary conditions:
	•	Overbought signals in a bull market: If either TQQQ RSI > 79 or SPY RSI > 80 triggers, the strategy actually goes to 25% UVXY + 75% BIL (see that outcome below), not full BIL. However, full 100% BIL occurs in bull regime if tech is not favored: e.g., SPY > 200MA but tech isn’t leading and isn’t oversold (XLK RSI ≤ KMLM RSI and XLK RSI ≥ 29). In that case the strategy opts to sit entirely in cash rather than hold stocks or take a short. It also happens if tech is leading but XLK RSI > 81 (too overbought) – the strategy exits to cash (BIL) to avoid an overheated market.
	•	Defensive in bear market: If volatility is high (UVXY RSI 75–84 range), the strategy goes 100% BIL to wait safely. Also, if tech has no edge (not oversold, not leading) and bonds have the momentum edge over shorting (BSV RSI > SQQQ RSI), the strategy chooses bonds (BSV) over cash. But pure cash (BIL) specifically is chosen in the bear regime when triggered by volatility or tech overbought in a downtrend (XLK RSI > 81 in bear, though that scenario likely coincides with a bounce that might have triggered other moves). Primarily, BIL is seen in moderately high volatility conditions or when the strategy in bull regime doesn’t want to short or go long – essentially a holding pattern.
	•	In summary, 100% BIL signifies “no confidence in any risk asset right now” – whether due to overbought conditions or lack of clear opportunity, the strategy parks in cash.
	•	100% in BSV – Bond Position (Short-Term Bonds):
Outcome: The entire portfolio is allocated to BSV, the Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF. BSV is another low-risk asset (holding short-term investment-grade bonds).
Triggers/Scenario: This position appears in a bear regime scenario as an alternative to shorting:
	•	If the strategy is in that final branch where tech isn’t a buy (not oversold, not leading) and it compares SQQQ vs BSV momentum, the outcome 100% BSV occurs if BSV’s 9-day RSI is higher than SQQQ’s. In other words, bonds are performing better than the short position. The strategy then opts to hold bonds for safety and a modest return rather than shorting the market.
	•	BSV essentially is chosen instead of cash in this specific case because it presumably offers a bit of yield/upside (perhaps interest rates are dropping or bonds rallying). It’s the strategy’s way of slightly optimizing the defensive stance – if bonds are trending up (e.g., in a flight-to-safety scenario), it will hold bonds rather than pure cash.
	•	100% in SQQQ – Short Tech Position (Leveraged Short Nasdaq):
Outcome: The entire portfolio is invested in SQQQ, the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF, which yields a 3× inverse exposure to Nasdaq 100 (essentially shorting tech stocks with leverage).
Triggers/Scenario: This happens only in a bear market regime, and specifically when tech is not oversold or strong (so the strategy wouldn’t be long) and when shorting has more momentum than bonds:
	•	After determining tech isn’t a buy (XLK not oversold and lagging), the strategy compares SQQQ vs BSV. If SQQQ’s RSI is higher than BSV’s, it indicates the downtrend in tech is robust (short positions are working well). The strategy will then allocate fully to SQQQ to capitalize on the continuing decline in tech stocks.
	•	In this scenario, the strategy is effectively saying: “The best play in this bear market right now is to be short tech.” It will remain short via SQQQ until conditions change (for instance, if a bounce causes SQQQ’s RSI to drop or bonds to gain momentum, it might switch out).
	•	This is the most aggressive defensive outcome – actually profiting from the market’s decline rather than just hiding. It is only used when confidence is high that the downtrend is intact (as evidenced by strong momentum in the inverse ETF).
	•	25% UVXY + 75% BIL – Partial Volatility Hedge with Cash:
Outcome: A quarter of the portfolio is in UVXY (volatility ETF) and the remaining three-quarters in BIL (cash equivalent).
Triggers/Scenario: This mixed allocation is a defensive posture taken in a bull market when a short-term top is suspected:
	•	In the bull regime, if TQQQ RSI > 79 or SPY RSI > 80 (extreme overbought conditions in tech or the broad market), the strategy doesn’t want to be long equities. It also anticipates a spike in volatility (since sharp pullbacks often coincide with VIX jumps). So instead of going 100% cash, it allocates 25% to UVXY as a hedge.
	•	The idea is that if a market pullback occurs, UVXY (VIX ETF) would likely surge, providing some gains to offset equity losses, while the 75% in BIL limits risk. If the market continues to climb despite being overbought, UVXY might drift down slowly (losing a small amount on 25% of portfolio) but the 75% in cash is unaffected, and the strategy can quickly pivot back to equities when conditions reset.
	•	This outcome is essentially a “warning phase” stance during a bull run – the strategy hasn’t gone fully risk-off (it’s not 100% cash; it keeps a foot in a hedge that could benefit from a correction). It’s a temporary protective measure during suspected market extremes.
	•	15% UVXY + 85% BIL – Deeper Volatility Hedge with Cash:
Outcome: 15% of the portfolio in UVXY and 85% in BIL.
Triggers/Scenario: This is a rare defensive allocation in a bear regime, during extreme volatility spikes:
	•	In a downtrend, if UVXY’s RSI > 84 (signaling exceptionally high volatility/fear), the strategy assumes a major market stress event is occurring or about to climax. It responds by keeping the bulk of the portfolio safe (85% in cash via BIL) but dedicating a small portion (15%) to UVXY.
	•	Rationale: In such extreme conditions, UVXY could see outsized gains if the turmoil continues (it serves as insurance), but volatility is also mean-reverting – a huge spike often collapses quickly – so the strategy limits exposure to 15% to avoid a big loss if volatility suddenly drops. This position hedges catastrophic risk while mostly preserving capital.
	•	This outcome is basically the most defensive stance that still holds any position beyond cash – used only when the market is possibly at a capitulation point. If conditions calm down (volatility RSI falls), the strategy would move either back to full cash or into other assets as other rules dictate.

In summary, the strategy can end up fully invested in a long position (TECL or SPXL) when it identifies a favorable opportunity, or fully in a short position (SQQQ) when it identifies strong downward momentum. At other times, it may choose fully defensive assets (100% BIL or BSV) when it wants no exposure to market risk. The two mixed UVXY+BIL positions represent intermediate defensive stances, hedging against volatility while retaining mostly cash. Each of these outcomes is directly tied to a set of conditions outlined in the decision process; as those conditions evolve day by day, the strategy will switch between these states.

By following this guide, a senior quant trader can understand the precise decision tree embedded in the “TECL for the Long Term” strategy and replicate these logic gates in a live trading environment. In practice, one would continuously feed in the current market data (SPY trend, RSI values for the relevant tickers) and at each decision point apply the rules above to determine the day’s allocation. The result is a rules-based, adaptive strategy that balances aggressive growth in tech with prudent risk management across varying market conditions.
