# Error Handling and Logging Action Plan

## Objective
Establish consistent logging practices and robust error propagation across all modules.

## Key Tasks
1. **Central Logging Configuration**
   - Configure the logging format and handlers in a single module imported by the CLI.
   - Avoid modifying global logging settings during module import.
2. **Remove Console Prints**
   - Replace `print` statements and direct console calls in utilities with structured logging calls.
   - Ensure log levels (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`) are used appropriately.
3. **Preserve Tracebacks**
   - Avoid catching broad `Exception` types unless re-raising after logging the full traceback.
   - Use `logging.exception` to capture stack traces when errors occur.
4. **Error Classes**
   - Define custom exception classes for predictable failure cases in execution and configuration modules.
   - Document expected exceptions in function docstrings.
5. **Testing**
   - Add tests that assert proper logging and error propagation when failures occur.
   - Use the `caplog` fixture in pytest to verify log messages.

## Deliverables
- Unified logging setup module.
- Refactored modules without bare `print` statements or silent error suppression.
- Tests ensuring errors are logged and propagated correctly.
- Updated developer guide describing logging conventions.
