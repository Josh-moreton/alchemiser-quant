### Project Review Summary

The repository contains a sizeable trading system built with Typer, Pydantic, Alpaca’s API, and extensive AWS integrations. The system has configuration, data, trading, execution, tracking, and CLI layers but lacks tests and cohesive automation. Many modules are well documented, yet there are opportunities to improve maintainability, reliability, and security.

### Prioritized To‑Do List

| Priority | Action Item | Justification | Suggested Tools/Methods |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | **Establish a testing framework and add coverage across modules** | No `tests/` directory despite `pytest` configuration; critical logic (data provider, strategy engines, error handler) is untested | `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `unittest.mock` |
| **✅ COMPLETED** | **~~Create `core/types.py` and migrate to strict typing~~** | ✅ **DONE**: 398+ lines of comprehensive TypedDict definitions; ~95% typing migration complete; remaining items are architectural refinements | `mypy --strict`, `pydantic` |
| **P0** | **Set up pre-commit hooks** | Ensures consistent formatting, linting, and type checking before commit | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` integrating `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest` |
| **P1** | **Refactor large modules into smaller, single-responsibility files** (e.g., `data_provider.py`, `cli.py`) | Improves readability, testability, and future maintenance | Apply “extract class/function” pattern |
| **P1** | **Expand docstrings and add module-level documentation where missing** | Some files (e.g., in `execution/`, `tracking/`) lack explanatory comments | `pydocstyle`, `sphinx` (for automated docs) |
| **P1** | **Standardize logging and prevent sensitive data leakage** | Logging utils exist, yet error branches often log generic `Exception`; ensure no API keys or secrets appear in logs | Consistent use of `get_logger` helpers |
| **P1** | **Introduce error hierarchy and remove generic `except Exception` blocks** | Fine-grained error types assist in troubleshooting and reduce silent failures | Custom exceptions, `contextlib` for error context |
| **P1** | **Implement secret rotation and TTL caching** | `SecretsManager` caches secrets indefinitely; rotation or TTL prevents stale credentials | Add TTL logic; consider AWS Parameter Store or Vault |
| **P2** | **Replace `flake8` with `ruff` in Makefile** | `pyproject.toml` uses `ruff`, but `Makefile` runs `flake8`; unify tooling | Update `Makefile`; rely solely on `ruff` |
| **P2** | **Pin dev dependencies and separate runtime vs. dev requirements** | `dependencies/requirements.txt` exports only main deps; dev tools (black, mypy, etc.) should be excluded from production bundle | `poetry export --without-hashes` |
| **P2** | **Introduce CI/CD pipeline** | Automates tests, linting, security scans, and deployments | GitHub Actions, `poetry install`, `pytest`, `mypy`, `ruff`, `aws sam build/deploy` |
| **P2** | **Add security scanning for dependencies and code** | Catch known vulnerabilities in dependencies and code patterns | `pip-audit`, GitHub Dependabot, `bandit` |
| **P2** | **Validate AWS error handling and introduce retries with backoff** | API calls to Secrets Manager, S3, Alpaca may fail transiently; currently mostly log and continue | `botocore` retry configs, `tenacity` |
| **P3** | **Asynchronous/parallel data fetching where possible** | `UnifiedDataProvider` uses synchronous requests; parallelism could reduce latency | `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, or `concurrent.futures` |
| **P3** | **Implement caching strategy for heavy computations** | Indicators, price data, and real-time feeds may benefit from LRU caches to reduce API calls | `functools.lru_cache`, Redis (if distributed) |
| **P3** | **Add architecture diagram and developer setup docs** | README gives short overview; a diagram and setup guide will assist onboarding | `mkdocs`, `PlantUML`, or `Mermaid` diagrams |
| **P3** | **Remove remaining TODOs and track technical debt in issues** | Only one explicit TODO found, but others may exist; track and resolve systematically | GitHub Issues or project board |
| **P3** | **Add typed protocols for strategy interfaces** | Standardize `Strategy` behavior (signal generation, allocation) and ease testing | `typing.Protocol` |

### Additional Recommendations

- **Virtual Environment Hygiene**: Document `poetry` workflow and ensure `.venv` is gitignored; consider including `.python-version` for `pyenv` users.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Introduce metrics around API latency, strategy execution time, and queue backlogs for better scalability insights.
- **Secrets Audit**: Ensure `.env` files and credentials are excluded via `.gitignore` and stored in a secure secret manager; verify IAM roles restrict access.

By addressing the above to‑dos in roughly descending priority, the project will move closer to a production‑ready, maintainable, and secure trading system.
