# Import Linter Remediation Plan - Deliverables Complete

**Issue**: [Create Remediation Plan for Import Linter Violations](https://github.com/Josh-moreton/alchemiser-quant/issues/XXXX)  
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**  
**Date**: 2024-09-25  

## Requested Deliverables - All Complete âœ…

### âœ… Investigation Document
**File**: `docs/import_linter_remediation.md`
- Every violation instance categorized by module pair
- Root cause analysis (shared â†’ execution_v2 breaks everything)
- Notes on intent and proposed resolution for each category
- Clear distinction between real violations and false positives

### âœ… Set of Follow-up Issues  
**File**: `docs/import_linter_sub_issues.md`
- **4 specific GitHub issues** broken down with full specifications
- Each issue includes: description, files to modify, success criteria, story points
- Logical grouping as requested in original issue

### âœ… Updated Understanding of Import-Linter Contracts
**Analysis**: The current ruleset is mostly correct, but there's a configuration issue
- **Real violations**: 3 shared â†’ execution_v2 + 6 orchestration direct imports = **9 total**
- **False violations**: 100+ business â†’ shared imports (these are actually allowed)
- **Recommendation**: Fix real violations, document that business â†’ shared is intended

### âœ… Remediation Plan Execution Strategy
**File**: `docs/import_linter_remediation.md` (Implementation section)
- 3-phase execution plan with clear timelines
- Resource requirements (2-4 weeks, 2-3 developers)
- Success metrics and risk assessment
- Dependencies and parallel work streams

## Key Insights Discovered

### ðŸ”´ Critical Finding: Root Cause Violation
**Shared â†’ Execution_v2** (3 imports) is the ROOT CAUSE that cascades to create Strategy/Portfolio violations
- Fix this one issue â†’ 4 broken contracts become 1-2 broken contracts
- Highest impact, fastest fix (3-5 days)

### ðŸŸ¡ Architecture Finding: False Violations  
**Business â†’ Shared** imports (100+ reported) are NOT violations
- These are explicitly allowed by the layered architecture rule
- Portfolio_v2 README states "Only imports from shared/ module"
- Should be ignored, not fixed

### ðŸŸ¢ Solution Finding: Event-Driven Patterns
**Orchestration â†’ Business** violations need proper event-driven architecture
- Replace direct handler imports with handler registry
- Use shared DTOs instead of direct model imports
- Implement proper event bus patterns

## Ready-to-Implement Sub-Issues

### Issue 1: [CRITICAL] Fix Shared â†’ Execution_v2 Import Violations
- **Priority**: Critical (blocks everything)
- **Effort**: 8 story points (3-5 days)
- **Impact**: 4 broken â†’ 1-2 broken contracts
- **Files**: 5 files to modify
- **Detailed specification**: Ready for immediate implementation

### Issue 2: [ARCHITECTURE] Implement Event-Driven Orchestration Patterns  
- **Priority**: High (after Issue 1)
- **Effort**: 13 story points (1-2 weeks)
- **Impact**: Clean orchestration architecture
- **Files**: 7+ files to modify
- **Detailed specification**: Handler registry + event patterns

### Issue 3: [DOCS] Document Module Import Architecture and Rules
- **Priority**: Medium (after Issues 1 & 2)
- **Effort**: 3 story points (2-4 days)
- **Impact**: Team clarity and onboarding
- **Deliverables**: ADRs, guides, updated READMEs

### Issue 4: [INVESTIGATION] Analyze Import Linter Layered Rule Behavior
- **Priority**: Low (parallel to others)
- **Effort**: 2 story points (1-2 days)  
- **Impact**: Resolve false violation confusion
- **Outcome**: Configuration fix or documentation

## Success Metrics Defined

### Immediate Success (Post Issue 1)
- âœ… Zero shared â†’ execution_v2 violations
- âœ… Import linter: 4 broken contracts â†’ 1-2 broken contracts  
- âœ… Strategy/Portfolio violations auto-resolved
- âœ… All DI functionality preserved

### Short-term Success (Post Issue 2)  
- âœ… Zero direct orchestration â†’ business imports
- âœ… Clean event-driven architecture patterns
- âœ… Handler registry operational
- âœ… All orchestration workflows functional

### Long-term Success (Post Issues 3 & 4)
- âœ… Clear team understanding of module boundaries
- âœ… Comprehensive architecture documentation
- âœ… Properly configured import linter rules

## Next Steps - Implementation Ready

1. **Create GitHub Issues**: Use the detailed specifications in `docs/import_linter_sub_issues.md`
2. **Assign Issue 1**: Critical path - needs immediate attention
3. **Team Briefing**: Present remediation plan and architecture insights
4. **Begin Implementation**: Start with shared â†’ execution_v2 fixes
5. **Track Progress**: Use defined success metrics to validate each phase

## Conclusion

This investigation has transformed a complex set of 100+ violations into a clear, actionable plan with just **9 real violations** to fix. The remediation strategy is designed to:

- **Maximize Impact**: Fix root cause first (biggest bang for buck)
- **Minimize Risk**: Preserve all existing functionality  
- **Enable Growth**: Establish proper architectural patterns
- **Educate Team**: Clear documentation and understanding

The plan is ready for immediate implementation with detailed specifications, success criteria, and execution strategy. ðŸš€
