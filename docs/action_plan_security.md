# Security Action Plan

## Objective
Eliminate hardcoded credentials and ensure sensitive data is protected throughout the codebase and deployment pipeline.

## Key Tasks
1. **Repository Audit**
   - Scan the history using `git secrets` or similar tools to identify leaked secrets.
   - Remove or rotate any discovered keys and document the remediation.
2. **Centralize Secret Storage**
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables to manage all API keys and credentials.
   - Ensure access policies follow the principle of least privilege.
3. **Logging Scrub**
   - Review all logging statements to ensure no secrets or personal data are output.
   - Add automated checks to prevent future logging of sensitive values.
4. **Dependency Updates**
   - Monitor vulnerabilities in dependencies via tools like `pip-audit`.
   - Pin package versions in `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` to known-good releases.
5. **Security Testing**
   - Add a security scanning stage in CI (e.g., `bandit` or `safety`).
   - Schedule regular dependency updates and secret audits.

## Deliverables
- Clean repository history with no embedded secrets.
- Automated secret management integrated into deployments.
- Logging free of sensitive data.
- Security scanning included in CI workflow.
