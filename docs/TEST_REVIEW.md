# 1. **Current Pytest Coverage**

- **test_config.py**: Only tests config loading and access, not trading logic.
- **test_indicators.py / test_indicators_manual.py**: Test technical indicator calculations (RSI, moving averages, etc.), but not strategy logic or portfolio outcomes.
- **test_multi_strategy.py**:
  - Tests TECL strategy engine, multi-strategy manager, multi-strategy trader, position tracking, config integration, and some market scenarios (bull/bear/volatility spike).
  - However, many test functions are stubs or incomplete (missing actual scenario logic and assertions).
- **test_tecl_strategy.py**: Runs the TECL strategy engine and prints indicator values and decision paths, but does not assert portfolio outcomes or cover all branches of the decision tree.

---

## 2. **Decision-Tree Trading Logic (from Nuclear.clj & TECL_for_the_long_term.clj)**

- Both CLJ files implement complex, nested decision trees based on technical indicators (RSI, moving averages, etc.).
- Portfolio allocations and asset choices change based on market regime (bull/bear), overbought/oversold conditions, and volatility spikes.
- Possible scenarios include:
  - Bull market, bear market, volatility spike, overbought/oversold for each key asset (SPY, TQQQ, IOO, VTV, XLF, XLK, KMLM, UVXY, BIL, BTAL, TECL, SPXL, SQQQ, BSV).
  - Defensive allocations (e.g., BIL, BTAL) and aggressive allocations (e.g., TECL, TQQQ, UVXY).

---

## 3. **Gaps in Current Testing**

- **No explicit tests for every branch of the decision tree.**
- **No parameterized tests for all combinations of indicator values** (e.g., RSI thresholds, moving average crossovers).
- **No assertions for expected portfolio allocations given specific market scenarios.**
- **No coverage for edge cases (e.g., all assets overbought, all assets oversold, mixed signals).**

---

## 4. **Recommendations for Complete Coverage**

### a. **Parameterize Market Scenarios**

- Create parameterized tests for all combinations of:
  - Market regime (bull/bear)
  - RSI thresholds for each asset (e.g., <30, 30-79, 80-81, >81)
  - Volatility spike (UVXY RSI > 81, > 84, etc.)
  - Defensive vs aggressive allocations

### b. **Assert Portfolio Outcomes**

- For each scenario, assert that the strategy engine produces the expected portfolio allocation (e.g., 100% BIL, 75% UVXY/25% BTAL, 100% TECL, etc.).

### c. **Test Multi-Strategy Consolidation**

- Assert that the multi-strategy manager correctly combines signals and allocations from both Nuclear and TECL strategies.

### d. **Edge Case Testing**

- Test cases where all assets are overbought/oversold, or where signals conflict.

### e. **Automate Decision Tree Traversal**

- Use mock indicator data to systematically traverse every branch of the decision tree in both CLJ files.

## 5. **Example Test Structure**

```python
import pytest
from core.tecl_strategy_engine import TECLStrategyEngine
from core.strategy_manager import MultiStrategyManager, StrategyType

@pytest.mark.parametrize("spy_price, spy_ma_200, spy_rsi, tqqq_rsi, expected_portfolio", [
    # Bull market, TQQQ overbought
    (500, 400, 50, 80, {"UVXY": 0.25, "BIL": 0.75}),
    # Bear market, TQQQ oversold
    (400, 500, 50, 29, {"TECL": 1.0}),
    # Volatility spike
    (500, 400, 50, 50, {"UVXY": 0.75, "BTAL": 0.25}),
    # Defensive allocation
    (500, 400, 82, 50, {"BIL": 1.0}),
    # ...add all other branches
])
def test_tecl_decision_tree(spy_price, spy_ma_200, spy_rsi, tqqq_rsi, expected_portfolio):
    engine = TECLStrategyEngine()
    indicators = {
        "SPY": {"current_price": spy_price, "ma_200": spy_ma_200, "rsi_10": spy_rsi},
        "TQQQ": {"rsi_10": tqqq_rsi},
        # ...add other indicators as needed
    }
    allocation, action, reason = engine.evaluate_tecl_strategy(indicators, {})
    assert allocation == expected_portfolio

# Repeat similar parameterized tests for Nuclear strategy and multi-strategy manager
```

## 6. **Next Steps**

- Refactor and expand your test files to cover all possible market scenarios and portfolio combinations as per the CLJ decision trees.
- Use parameterized tests and mock indicator data to systematically cover every branch.
- Assert expected portfolio allocations for each scenario.

---

**Summary:**  
Your current tests do not fully cover all possible market scenarios and portfolio combinations. To achieve complete coverage, you should add parameterized tests for every branch of the decision tree logic in your strategies, assert expected portfolio outcomes, and test multi-strategy consolidation and edge cases. This will ensure your trading system is robust and behaves as expected in all market conditions.
