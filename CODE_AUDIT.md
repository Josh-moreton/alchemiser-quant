# Code Audit Summary

This document captures the results of the line-by-line review of the repository. Each section lists detected issues, recommended fixes, and an overall code quality rating.

## main.py

**Issues**
- `Config` imported globally but only used inside `run_trading_bot`.
- Duplicate logic between `run_live_trading_bot` and `run_paper_trading_bot` makes maintenance harder.
- Heavy use of `print` for logging; no consistent logger.
- Monkey-patching `rebalance_portfolio` in `run_live_trading_bot` is fragile and may break thread safety.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Inject configuration instead of constructing `Config` multiple times.
- Factor common logic into helper functions to avoid duplication.
- Replace prints with `logging` module calls.
- Refactor to capture orders without monkey-patching.

**Code Quality Rating**: **6/10** – Functional but lacks separation of concerns and reusability.

## lambda_handler.py

**Issues**
- Thin wrapper only imports from main and returns success string; any exception bubbles up unlogged.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Add error handling and logging for Lambda context.

**Code Quality Rating**: **8/10** – Simple and works but minimal robustness.

## debug_rsi.py

**Issues**
- Runs network calls and sleeps directly; for debugging only.
- No exception handling around API calls.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Add try/except around data fetches.
- Move debug code under `if __name__ == "__main__":` (already done).

**Code Quality Rating**: **5/10** – OK for a throw-away script but not production ready.

## debug_rsi_focused.py

**Issues**
- Hard-coded absolute path in `sys.path.append('/Users/joshmoreton/GitHub/LQQ3')` breaks portability.
- Unused `pandas` import.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Remove the path manipulation and rely on relative imports.
- Clean up unused imports.

**Code Quality Rating**: **4/10** – Debug script with portability problems.

## core/__init__.py

**Issues**
- Only comments; no problems found.

**Code Quality Rating**: **9/10** – Trivial.

## core/alert_service.py

**Issues**
- `create_alerts_from_signal` performs many responsibilities, making unit testing harder.
- Regex parsing of portfolio string may fail silently if format changes.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Split portfolio handling logic into separate functions.
- Validate parsed values and raise errors on malformed input.

**Code Quality Rating**: **6/10** – Works but somewhat monolithic.

## core/config.py

**Issues**
- `__getitem__` throws `KeyError` if key missing; not caught anywhere.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Use safer access or document that missing keys raise errors.

**Code Quality Rating**: **7/10** – Simple but slightly brittle.

## core/data_provider.py

**Issues**
- Secrets fetched and Alpaca client initialized in constructor; expensive side effect on import.
- `_get_alpaca_data` swallows exceptions broadly and returns empty DataFrame, which can hide bugs.
- Hard-coded region `"eu-west-2"` and live trading keys by default may be unsafe.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Delay secret fetching until needed and allow region to be configured.
- Log errors more specifically and propagate when appropriate.

**Code Quality Rating**: **6/10** – Functional but couples I/O strongly to object creation.


## core/indicators.py

**Issues**
- None significant; functions are straightforward.

**Code Quality Rating**: **8/10** – Clean utility module.

## core/nuclear_trading_bot.py

**Issues**
- Configuration and logging configured at import time, causing side effects during tests.
- Emoji characters appear corrupted (`�`) in print statements.
- `safe_get_indicator` returns 50.0 silently on any exception, possibly hiding data problems.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Initialize logging and config in the CLI layer instead.
- Ensure source file encoding (UTF-8) and valid characters.
- Let `safe_get_indicator` surface errors or log them.

**Code Quality Rating**: **6/10** – Complex file with side effects and some brittle logic.

## core/secrets_manager.py

**Issues**
- Falls back to environment variables silently if AWS calls fail, which may hide misconfiguration.
- Uses broad `except Exception` in several places.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Log detailed errors when falling back.
- Catch specific exceptions.

**Code Quality Rating**: **7/10** – Reasonably structured but could be more explicit.

## core/strategy_engine.py

**Issues**
- No major issues; strategy methods return tuples of strings.

**Code Quality Rating**: **8/10** – Cleanly implemented strategy logic.

## core/telegram_utils.py

**Issues**
- Secrets retrieved from AWS at module import time, causing network calls whenever the module is imported.
- `requests.post` errors only printed; not propagated.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Lazily load secrets when `send_telegram_message` is first called or inject them.
- Raise exceptions or return error details for calling code.

**Code Quality Rating**: **6/10** – Functional but with heavy side effects.

## execution/__init__.py

**Issues**
- No functional code; fine.

**Code Quality Rating**: **9/10**.

## execution/alpaca_trader.py

**Issues**
- Logging configured on import, limiting reuse in other environments.
- Long, monolithic methods with many responsibilities, e.g., `rebalance_portfolio` over 150 lines.
- Polling loop in `place_order` uses sleep; could block event loops or Lambdas.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Configure logging in CLI.
- Split large methods into smaller units.
- Consider asynchronous polling or timeout callbacks.

**Code Quality Rating**: **6/10** – Implements functionality but hard to maintain.

## execution/improved_rebalance.py

**Issues**
- Module expects to be mixed into `AlpacaTradingBot`; not integrated automatically.
- Extensive console output and sleeps for settlement.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Convert to a class method or clearly document integration.
- Replace prints with logging.

**Code Quality Rating**: **5/10** – Experimental script with limited polish.

## bots/telegram_bot.py

**Issues**
- Subprocess calls run `python main.py` without sanitizing mode string; risk if modified.
- Tokens loaded at import time from AWS; slows startup and couples script to secrets manager.
- Long `start_command` message built inline; hard to maintain.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Validate mode before passing to subprocess.
- Load secrets lazily or pass them via environment variables.
- Extract message templates.

**Code Quality Rating**: **6/10** – Works but some security and maintainability concerns.

## tests/test_config.py

**Issues**
- Asserts specific values from `config.yaml`; changes to config break tests unnecessarily.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Use fixtures or mocks so tests check structure, not exact constants.

**Code Quality Rating**: **7/10**.

## tests/test_indicators.py / tests/test_indicators_manual.py

**Issues**
- Straightforward; no major problems.

**Code Quality Rating**: **8/10**.

## tests/test_telegram_bot.py

**Issues**
- Very large test file with complex scenarios.
- Contains truncated code at end ("assert main_alert.symbol == \"SPY\"" followed by command prompt) indicating incomplete file.
- Extensive fixture generation may slow tests.

**Recommended Fixes**
- Split into multiple focused test modules.
- Ensure file ends correctly.
- Use fixtures to reduce duplication.

**Code Quality Rating**: **5/10** – Provides coverage but unwieldy and possibly incomplete.

## Overall Assessment

The codebase is functional but many modules configure logging or fetch secrets when imported, leading to side effects and making testing harder. Several large functions mix business logic with I/O and rely heavily on prints instead of structured logging. Debug scripts contain hard-coded paths. Unit tests are comprehensive but sometimes brittle. With refactoring toward dependency injection, cleaner separation of concerns, and improved error handling, maintainability would improve significantly. Overall quality is moderate but not production-ready across the board.
