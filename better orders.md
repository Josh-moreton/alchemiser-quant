# better orders

Here’s the **retail‑optimised execution ladder** for **fast 3x leveraged ETFs** (like LQQ3, TQQQ, SPXL), designed to mimic **prop‑desk logic** but realistic for Python + Alpaca latency.

This approach balances **speed**, **slippage protection**, and **realistic execution** for a 1‑4 day swing trader.

## **Execution Ladder – Professional Swing Trading Style**

### **Step 0 – Pre‑Check (Before Market Open)**

* **Confirm market conditions**:

  * Pre‑market spread and liquidity (use Alpaca’s data feed).
  * Note if the **bid/ask is wide (> \$0.05–0.10)** – plan to **wait 1–3 mins** post‑open.
* **Determine max acceptable slippage** (in cents) for your trade size.
* **Prepare your target position size** in advance.

---

### **Step 1 – Open Assessment**

* **Time:** 09:30:00 ET → **don’t fire immediately** unless spread is tight.
* **Logic:**

  1. Pull **best bid/ask & spread** via websocket.
  2. Decide:

     * **Spread ≤ 2–3¢** → execute immediately.
     * **Spread > 5¢** → wait 1–2 mins for spreads to normalise.

---

### **Step 2 – Initial Order (Aggressive Marketable Limit)**

* **Type:** Limit order at **ask + 1 tick** for buy (or bid – 1 tick for sell).
* **Size:** Full order size unless you want to scale in.
* **Timeout:** 2–3 seconds max (we are trading fast ETFs).

This is the **pro equivalent of “hit the market but with a seatbelt”**.

---

### **Step 3 – Peg / Adjust (Optional)**

If initial order **doesn’t fill fully**:

1. **Cancel immediately**.
2. **Re‑peg 1–2 ticks higher (buy) or lower (sell)**.
3. **Timeout 2s**.

Two re‑pegs max; more than that risks chasing.

---

### **Step 4 – Market Fallback**

If still unfilled after 2–3 attempts:

* **Send market order** for remaining shares.
* **Rationale:** The opportunity cost of missing the move outweighs a few cents of slippage.

---

### **Step 5 – Post‑Fill Check**

* **Log executed price vs mid and NBBO** to review fill quality.
* Optional: Store **VWAP vs Fill** for analytics; helps refine future ladder steps.

---

## **Timing Guidance**

* **09:30:00 – 09:32 ET:** Only execute if spreads are tight.
* **09:32 – 09:35 ET:** Safer execution; spreads usually compress.
* **After 09:35 ET:** Market has stabilised; you can revert to simpler execution.

## **Key Notes**

1. **No midpoint games at the open** – you will miss fills.
2. **Leverage ETFs are liquid** – the spread cost is small relative to P\&L swings.
3. **Execution certainty > shaving pennies** for swing trades.
4. **Marketable limit with 2–3s timeout** is the **pro default for volatile assets**.

If you want, I can now **turn this into a Python/Alpaca code template** for your bot that:

* Uses **websocket best bid/ask**
* Implements this **execution ladder with timeouts and re‑pegs**
* Falls back to **market safely**
